            "bim not going to lie  i came here with my girlfriend to see if any drama would ensuenot with us but with other patrons  we also were coming here because it was steps away from the movie theater which we headed to after our dinner  nnwhen we walked in there were  men sitting at a table eating and chatting with sam one of the owners  sam greeted us and said we could sit anywhere we wanted  he also joked that as we were  ladies coming in we could sit with these  gentlemen if we wanted to  we all giggled and my girlfriend and i chose a top a few tables away  nnother than that the restaurant was empty  it is decorated nicely and the pastries in the pastry window looked divine  our server approached us and i couldnt help but notice her uniform shirt saying i speak feline meow  nnwe placed our orders which were taken on an ipad by the server  i ordered amys signature homemade soup of the day  lobster bisque with roasted corn   it was delicious and i gobbled it up  i believe it also had some pearl onions in there which was a nice touch  my friend and i split amys homemade lemon garlic hummus with flat bread   we loved it  it was tasty with that hint of lemon that was not overpowering  we scooped up that hummus until there was nothing left in the dish  nnfor our entrees my friend ordered the sweet  spicy asian peanut salad   she enjoyed every bite  i also enjoyed it too and found myself eating off her plate several times  i originally ordered the pearl couscous salad  but amy came back and said they were out of that entree  i ordered the orzo pesto pea salad  instead  it was not my favorite but it was still good  for some reason i thought it was going to be warm by its appearance but how could it be if it was a salad right  so my first bite i was caught off guard at the coldness of it all  the peas were perfectly crunchy and worked well with the orzo  nnwe wanted to get some dessert but we were running behind for our movie so we said wed have an excuse to come back another day  i also heard that they recently changed their menu to be more cost and health friendly  i do wish they still had some pasta dishes as that was what i was craving when we first arrived  but her menu consists of only soup salad and sandwiches  nnamy and sam were very friendly  after eating their food and realizing that it really is good  and seeing amy work her butt off in the back making sure the plateups looked acceptable i felt for this couple and as my friend and i later discussed  this is a restaurant that they as a couple put their heart and soul in  then came gordon ramsay who ripped them to shreds  and who knows maybe their food was horrible then but if you really think about it gordon wasnt very nice about how they ran their show and i know i know gr is known to be a shrew  and i think for anyone who has a lot of pride of what they are representing and to have someone come in and put you on blast you cant help but be a bit defensive  it obviously went too far but i guess once things start going downhill it just snowballs and at that point you lose control  and the people who come in and you see them on the news for amy and sam lashing out again i truly believe are people who purposely come in and antagonize them  because what we experienced was a very pleasant and friendly couple with abovepar food and service  nnnote  sam still controls the register though  the server just stands there and waits while he rings up the transaction  so odd nni gave this place  stars instead of  because when i think of dinner i think of something more heavy and not just soups and saladsand i think of sandwiches for lunch  it was still good and wed definitely come back again next time we watch another movie in that plazabterrible terrible terrible horrendous food and worse service never again i have been to some pretty bad places in my day but this takes it the restaurant and area are nice and clean howeverba group of twelve of us came here after a movie one evening and even though the service was slow the dessert and espresso was aok goodnnyes we watched in horror the meltdown on tv a few months ago  but the night we were here there was no sign of that stuff  sammy was our server and he seemed somewhat confused since we initially asked for six separate checks  but in the end one of us picked up the tab after getting tired of waiting  nnsince amys was half empty he came over and chatted with us  hard to believe but he was friendly personable and yes funny  the desserts were outstanding  i dont know who made them but they were very goodnnmy friend richard s was with us that evening he has gone back a few times and loves the place  and no he hasnt watched the tv episode  at this point i have mixed feelings about recommending amys  yelp friends ursula cheryl and monica have all had positive experiences while my friend marvin hates the place  nnso ill let you decidebthis is officially the worst place on earth nfood is disgusting the guy that owns this craphole is a duchebag the lady in the kitchen is a psycho we waited for our pizza for over an hour i would rather eat a frozen pizza from the super market rather than going back there the cook is a gold digging hussy and the guy is a delusional jerk thats going to be dumped as soon as the doors to this st hole close nnto all the staff run run run you deserve respect and can do so much better nnthere is nothing good about this placebi am going  stars because we had such a relaxing time and the food was so good and the flat bread and tepanade was awesome  the food was delicious would totally go backbwe decided to try amys baking company of course after seeing it on tv  i always go in with an open mind when you hear the negative so much  we decided to try it out for lunch today and were really happy with everything  sammie sat us and was as nice as can be  we ordered the gnocchi bolognese and the pepperoni and sausage pizza  both were super good  the flavors were really great on both  the crust was perfect on the pizza  i can tell they use really fresh ingredients  at the end of our meal amy came out to say hi  we will be back  i would encourage people to try the restaurant and give it a shot before you write a review just because you saw it on a tv show  yelp reviews should be honestbthe owners are crazy lunatics and amys a pre madonna  they rob the employees of tips why would anyone support these greedy neurotic creepsbawesome food awesome owners cute restaurant and the best dessert of my life go check amys out because you wont be disappointedbwent after work a couple weeks ago because i had heard about amys lemon meringue tart  at first i was a little hesitant because the desserts are  each but totally worth it both amy and sammy were a delight to speak with  we really want to go back for her foodbfirst time at amys was amazing  the food was delicious and owners are exteremenly friendly and nice   i can not wait to go back and take the family  it is a must try and you will not be disappointedbim a little ashamed to admit this but i came here strictly due to the crazy publicity i was surprised at how nice the owners were to us   however sami said three times to us to come back for dinner as its delicious  owners shouldnt have to try to convince customers that many times in the five minutes there   i actually enjoyed the chocolate macaroon  the apple pie was the worst i have ever had  excessively sweet and way too much cinnamon   way too expensive for what we bought  seems more of a tourist trap than anything  guiltybmy husband and i just had dinner at amys baking company the food and service was fabulous we will definitely be going backbamazing  amazing amazing absolutely one of the best dinning experiences i have had  the food was excellent and the service was great  my entire family had a great time i had the salami panini which was delicious then the crime brxcxbblxcxae and coffee finished everything off it was excellent  samy snd amy are amazing people and are now our friendsbabsolutely disgusting i was visiting a friend in arizona and thought itd be cool to eat there for lunch since i saw kitchen nightmares i didnt know what to expect but i thought it wouldnt be as bad as the experience i had i ordered the blue ribbon burger and my friend ordered the garlic chicken mushroom pizza it took forever for our food to come and our food was definitely not worth the wait my burger was undercooked and complicated and my friends pizza was undercooked and doughy the owners were loud and angry which is why we did not make a complaint the restaurant was clean and looked nice but sadly its food was bad and the owners were worsebi watch ramsay show sometimes  i saw different things  but never i saw so stubborn  angry  selfish owners like youamy  i cant believe you guys keep tips  dont have a right to do that you dont have a right to treat people the way you treat your employees  they also humans if you didnt know  just because they came work for u dont mean u owned them i dont care how u cook  but u probably cant cook  i trust the chef   i would never eat food that you prepared  its must have some of those poison you sprinkle from your ugly mouth  ni hope one of those poor people who happened to work for u  sue the hell out of u  i wish there is law that can punish that kind of ppl like u nyou an ugly horrible person  your soul is ugly to me hope u go out of business straight to hell for all that u done bvisiting from saskatchewan canada familiar with the hype  gordon ramsey episode decided to give the place a try and form our own opinionsnnhad the artichoke dip and tapenade with flatbread probably the most unique interesting and tasty artichoke dip ive ever had tapenade was great but nothing to write home about great flatbreadnni had the french pressed coffee   could have been a little stronger for my taste girlfriend had an americano likes her coffee strong but said it was a little too muchnnwould have loved to take in a full meal but didnt have the time hope to come back some daynnservice was great though we were the only ones in the restaurant at the time amy and sammy went out of their way to get a picture with us after the meal very kind and graciousbmy mom and i have eaten here at least six times the food has always been good service consistent and the deserts out of this worldbmy mom and i went to the bakery tonight to get dessert it was really good they were extremely friendly and the entire place was spotless i dont think its fair that they are getting reviews by people that have never gone inside i will go backbthings you may not have known about amys baking company  if you have food allergies

made to order food  can not get any better than thisbwhat we saw were  owners in a fight to save their business the food is amazing the gnocchi is outstanding with lots of variety the desert is delicious even after the kitchen was closed and we were finninshing up sammy was still welcoming people in and making coffee and tea drinksbtraveling through scottsdale and decided to stop and see if this nightmare was really so bad walked in and sammy was right there he was very nice and sat us at a table and we picked out some desserts as it was the middle of the afternoon not many people were in and we just decided to get desserts after looking at all the beautiful cakes we decided to get the creme brxcxbblxcxae and a pixcxba colada cake first bite and we loved it nothing like the disaster we thought we were walking into amy even came out to say hi and later we asked to take a picture they had no problem with this and seemed quite used to it after the show great experience and if im ever in scottsdale again i will be sure to stop in and get a sweet treatnnlove the texansbi went here with a friend to waste some time before our movie we had both seen the kitchen nightmares video of this restaurant i had previously been in before i watched the video and loved the food i was absolutely shocked when i saw the video we walked in to the lovely restaurant and was greeted by sammy we picked out our deserts and sat down then amy came out and greeted us i absolutely loved the service here and will most certainly be backblet me start out by saying i really wanted to hate this place after seeing the tv show my wife and i are vacationing in scotsdale and said we had to go check it out for ourselves we walked in and the environment was so friendly we were greeted by sammy and he asked us to sit down wherever we liked we sat down and ordered the herbed flatbread and wow was it delicious clearly homemade bread with a perfect blend of herbs we then decided to split the brie apple and prosciutto with an apple compoteit comes with a side salad with a citrus honey dressing that was absolutely to die for the sandwich was nothing short of perfect we made our way over to the baked goods counter and got two desserts the chocolate cake and the creme brule cheesecake i couldnt stop eating the decedent cake it was gone within  bites the cheesecake was also amazing but we decided to save it for the family to try i gave this  stars because i couldnt find a single thing wrong with the restaurant after we ate sammy shook both our hands and said thank you for coming in i will be back for more food and dessert i highly recommend this restaurant i wish they were in el pasobabsolute most amazing hidden jewel of a restaurant  i dine out often and would highly recommend this restaurant  not anything ordinary here  the desserts are unmatched and the owners are absolutely the most sincere hard working passionate wonderful people i have ever had the pleasure of meeting  amy makes all of her creations from scratch by hand and it shows in the presentation and flavors of everything she masters  seriously this place is not to be mistaken for the averagenot by a long shot  treat yourselfsave room for dessertthank me laterbvisited this place on friday night at  pm we were pleased to see abc bistro stayed open until pm and decided to go for it we enter and samy says to sit in the patio we asked to stay inside and he said no on the patio because we have to clean up for tomorrow  that should have been a sign but we stayed he offered to turn the misters on but never didnnthe goodnfor  the salmon burger and honey citrus salad were really excellent the bun was surprisingly good and the dressing on the salad was among the very best ive ever tried the burger was more of a fried salmon croquette which was unexpected because i dont like fried food too much and did not think i was ordering a fried dish but it also was goodnthe restroom was impeccable and the restaurant inside was tastefully decorated and scrupulously clean unfortunately we were not allowed to sit insidennthe bad nsoft drinks are  and refills were not forthcoming yes i know its about a dollar more per drink than is customary in similar establishments but for some reason it bugged me maybe because it was hot on the pationfor  you get  gnocchi swimming in a half a quart of marinara with a generous amount of oil slicking the top of it if you wish to add more parmesan than the minuscule amount that comes with it be prepared to pay extra when is the last time you paid extra for parmesan cheese in a restaurant the vast amount of sauce and small portion of gnocchi was really puzzling the marinara itself was a bit acidic and somewhat bitter other reviewers also mentioned that the sauce is generous and the portions less so and that was our experience as well after having finished all the gnocchi about  ounces of sauce were left on the soup plate interestingly no bread was offered which is surprising for a bread companynaround  the ugly bright lights come on inside and light up the patio killing the mood the waitresses start pulling up all the tablecloths outside leaving us surrounded by naked plastic tablesnthe waitresses and samy were busy cleaning and we were the only table left in the restaurant after waiting for some time alone on the patio we knocked on the glass to get their attentionnnwe asked for our check paid and left we would have offered constructive criticism but thought wed cut our losses and leave i would not return mainly because of the attitude the fact that parmesan and bread costs extra and the wrecking of the mood with the cleanup and bright lights i can overlook a dish i didnt enjoy but not this attitude where the last two customers are an inconveniencebwas in arizona to do comedy  this place isnt far from stand up scottsdale  i regret setting foot here  the ownership are horrible people with a rotten attitude i got a pizza that was clearly reheated and it was downright rotten  they told me i dont know what real good pizza tastes likennyou sons of bitches  i am from san francisco  weve got more good restaurants in a square mile radius than the entire state of arizonannstay away from here  i got a burger from this other place around the block from stand up whom i wont name herebwent for the first time today for lunch  had reservations based on other reviews and of course tv  however my coworker and i were in the area and decided to give it a try  we were pleasantly surprised  the restaurant was slow only  other occupied tables  we were greeted right away by samy and told to sit wherever we liked  we decided to order the meat the ball pizza to share  samy was very attentive and friendly   the pizza was really good  we checked out the dessert display on the way in and everything looked amazing so we ordered the candy bar tart to go  it too was fantastic  only things preventing me from giving  stars are as follows  never took a drink order or offered anything other than water even though the restaurant was slow it did take awhile to get our food and then to get the check  i wouldnt recommend going if you are on a time crunch  cant speak as to how criticism is handled as our experience was pleasant and it appeared the other diners were happy as well  would definitely visit again if in the area  they told us they will be revamping their menu in octoberbi went here because it was on gordon ramsays shownnmy roommate roommate and i are  yo malesnni thought the show might be kind of staged but no i saw the owner the guy be very rude to a costumer wanting a specific kind of cake it was entertaining and probably made the experience worthwhile nnthe menu did not appeal to either of us not much i wanted to eat but that could just be our style in foodnni ordered the burger just like ramsay did on the show he was right it was way too juicy and the bun fell apart gross it had a bad flavor and the burger juice was all over the placenni would give a c my roommate had a c meal as well nnit was a fun experience but food could be found better almost anywherebcame in with my father in between lunch and dinner hour ish and was seated on the patio by the owner server he is a very fun guy and seemed very accommodating he really went into detail about the different ingredients of all of the pizzas after we were unsure of what one to order we said we wanted something a little bit different than the usual fast food pizza and so we chose the fig pizza we ordered the small since it was just two of us after he advised us that they are actually pretty big and he did not want us to over order which shows us he actually cares and isnt just a greedy guy the pizza arrived promptly and it was a beauty you can really tell just by looking at is that everything is made from scratch the crust was soft but firm and the pizza was thin and cooked crispy and perfect the flavor contrast with the sour cheese and sweet onion and fig were to die for overall the experience could not have been better a service and food the only two things i care about when dining out also it is right across from the movie theater which would be good before or after a movie i would definitely recommend and will definitely be back if i am on that side of town againbwent there once for a meet up with some of my friends who were locals i was visiting from out of another city i asked if any of my food was frozen they told me no when i got my ravioli it was frozen i didnt eat it and sent it back my friends and i went to leave and they demanded i pay for my food but i didnt eat anything i was the only one who ordered anything as my friends already ate they wouldnt let us leave threatening to call the police on us if we didnt pay for our food but i was the only one who ordered they called the police the police came they escorted me out and i left with my friends the reason i went was because i didnt think it was that bad i thought they were playing it up for the cameras but i was so very wrong it is not played up at all these people really are crazybok i will disclose i was just the pick up person for a call in order nyeshad heard all the stuff and the person who sent me has left a one star rating they wanted me to give my opinion on service as i will also disclosei do in home care and service is what it is all about based on thathow hard could a pick up be norder was ready butthey took their time to bag it upnno offering of anything else such as condimentsnno thank youeven after they saw i left a tip maybe two bucks is not  but it was a to go orderbi was in the area visiting friends in january  i suggested to them to go to abc for dinner and they looked at me like i was insane with that decision i had seen the kitchen nightmares episode and i wanted to give my own review from my own perspective and not from what reality tv can shownnfirst i have to say that i had desert first personal policy of mine which was the chocolate cake and it was absolutely delicious so as far as desserts i give amy  starsnnnow the rest of the experience was where it all went down hill drastically i ordered a pizza and the outer crust was beautiful and very rustic like the actual innards of the pizza was raw and soggy the flavor was strong with garlic on one side and completely bland on the other side i sent it back asking if it could be put back in the oven for another  minutes and the shrill scream that came from the kitchen was enough to make me lose my appetite my friends had gnocchi which tasted freezer burned and no matter how much sauce is put on the freezer burn taste doesnt go awaynnits a beautiful restaurant and well worth the money put into it but our server was so nervous and jumpy afraid that she would do anything wrong when i asked if she gets the tips from the tables she shook her head no since i was paying the bill i paid it in cash to the penny and then i sought out my server and gave her a  tip for putting up with the environment she works undernnin my opinion all of these glowing  star rating must be from friends or relatives to offset the lower ratings im from nj so i didnt travel  miles to bully these people i wanted to form my own opinion and it spoke for itselfnnhow they are open is a mystery however i do wish them well and that they continue to grow and learn and be open mindedbtook the family this afternoon to get coffee and deserthad a great experiencesammy and amy where awesomegreat chatting with youlooking forward to coming back and trying the pizzananyone going to the restaurant with a biased opinionshame on younwill confidently recommend the restaurant to family and friendsngood luck with everything sammy and amy and hope all the idiots bullying and harassing you get a lifekarma has an amazing way of showing herselfbwhy we decided to give the place a trynok so i was on a netflix binge watching kitchen nightmares i watched the first two seasons and decided to search online for gordon ramsey the first result that popped up was amys baking company right here in my home town of scottsdale az nnso i watched the episode online like and then proceeded to watch all the local news and radio interviews of abc nnnext i decided to give the place a try for myself before i placed final judgment something i think everyone should do with the ability to think for themselvesnnthe food reviewnnmy wife and i went for our friday night dinner and started with the flat bread it tasted amazing it was seasoned perfectly with italian seasoning and oil the bottom was flakey and crispy and the top was a beautiful golden brownnnwe ordered the same things that were criticized on the show i ordered a blue ribbon burger medium and my wife ordered a small fig pizzannthere was a little bit of a wait for the entrees but i have never eaten somewhere with this quality of food where there wasnt at least this long of a wait for the entree nnwhen the main course did arrive they both came to the table at the same time and were perfectly cooked the pizza crust  was golden brown on on top and crispy on the bottom there were fresh ingredients and extra stretchy mozzarella on top i was honestly afraid to try the pizza cause i was figuring there would be a fig paste similar to fig newtons on the pizza that was not the case at all there were fresh chunks of fig sprinkled on the pizza it was very tasty and this is coming from a pepperoni only guy nnas for the blue ribbon burger i thought the taste was great the pilled high toppings of cheese mushrooms and bacon were great the burger had a very peppery flavor which i happen to really like the outside of the burger was seared to have a smokey grilled flavor and the inside was lightly pink and filled with juice nnthe only complaint about the burger was the bun it fell apart on me before i could finish it but this wasnt a deal breaker for menni also got the sweet potato fries with ranch the fries tasted good and had a great flakey crispy outer crust on them nnthe priceneverything on the menu is separated sammie said this was done to let the customer pick and choose what they want without paying for things they dont want nnfor example if you want flat bread with hummus you have to order them separately for  eachnnif you want the burger and fries you have to order them separately  for the burger and  for the friesnnverdictnthis is one of the best local restaurants my wife and i have eaten at here in the valley we plan to make this a regular spot for our dinner dates its also in the same parking lot at a movie theater so its perfect for movie nights nngive them a try before bashing them because of what you saw on tv nnnote on the reality tv aspectni personally work in the video production business and have a good idea of what happens behind the scenes at these reality tv shows just like scripted tv reality tv needs drama to sell i do believe that the owner has trouble accepting criticism but i also feel that many things were exaggerated and egged on by the producers of this show even so these people have been put through the fire and have not given up they have only made changes for the positive regarding the waitstaff and tipsbyesterday i went with a friend and had the artichoke dipman the bread they serve with it is incredible  i also had the curried chicken sandwich my friend had the walnut chicken sandwich  both were deliciousnnwe had the bread pudding to finish but i tell you any of their desserts are star so you cant go wrong with any of themnneverything they do appears to be meticulously prepared with fresh ingredients    they are also sweet people and i felt like i was receiving old school service attended to at every stepbdo not eat here   i ordered a margherita pizza and it was doughy and soggy i asked the waiter if she could put it in the oven a bit longer  minutes later one of the owners sammy comes out and starts screaming at me telling me to get the fuck out of his restaurant then the other owner amy came out and joined in with her husband they said i couldnt leave until i paid for the shitty pizza i threatened to call the cops and they got out of the way i have never experienced anything like this rumor has it amy is obsessed with her cats and thinks their human beings and sammy her husband steals the waitresses tipsbhave gone a few times over the past years never thought it was great or bad just a local neighborhood place with a nice outdoor cafe  a few weeks ago an out of town guest wanted to go and i gave in  it was really good  nice atmosphere i had never had dinner or eaten inside before we all thought our dinners were great and the desserts were outstandingbare you kidding me i love this place the desserts are amazingstaff was cool and amy was a noneventkeep it up and dont let them get you down cheers from seattlebi took my two year old maddie  for lunch on friday the owner greeted us at the door and was very gracious the server immediately brought a clean high chair to our table i ordered a pizza and an egg salad sandwichnthe pizza was delivered sliced and cut up for a two year old she ate a little so we boxed it up the egg salad was delicious i make great egg salad and must admit this was excellent piled high on a toasted bun with capers and spices that were becoming to a gourmet egg salad i never had before the server was attentive and patient with us a two year old can be demanding however the server was responsive and very thoughtfulnwe paid our bill and upon leaving the owner addressed my  granddaughter affectionately and told us to come back soonnit was a pleasant experience i will return with friends and husband after a movie ni am not one to get caught up in gossip and media hype i didnt go there because of iti basically forgot about it until i was there then let the truth bear itselfnot looking for anything negativeand maddie and i had a great dining experiencento all of you critics shakespere said much ado about nothingnmy egg salad was somethingncontinued successi will be backbi have not seen the show but friends had when they suggested we try this place  i had of course heard all sorts of things though so i wasnt sure what we were getting into luckily things turned out great  samy and amy were very nice to us  and the desserts were incredible we were the only ones there that night and samy came over to say hi and give us some background about the place and the infamous show i got the feeling he gives that talk to lots of people he also shared that he is not in the best of health right now and that he and his wife are the only ones working there if one of them cant work that day  they dont open he also said they will be closing the restaurant for good in mid june and are planning on only selling their desserts wholesale to other restaurants im sorry to see them gobthe food here is really subpar dont come here for a good meal nnyou should however come here for the entertainment the owners are literally insane its fun to watch them go crazy yelling at people they make terrible food people complain then the owners yell at the customersblike most people probably i went here because i wanted to see what the kitchen nightmares hullabaloo was really all about  samy was on the floor managing things and i saw amy in the back briefly but she didnt come out front  samy is really intense but his heart seems to be in the right place  it really does seem like he wants everyone to have a great experience  his intensity i think might simply be cultural and i would encourage anyone who goes to be patient and know this  i did watch the show and it seems like amy is a nut case but its reality tv and the producers could probably make mother theresa look cray so i took that with a grain of salt  the pastries looks unbelievably delicious  if i wasnt trying to lose weight i would have eaten everything in the case  i had a caprese salad which was fine but it was july which to me means that the tomatoes should be amazing  these tomatoes looked and tasted like they were bought at safeway and never really ripened  it was soaked in a little too much dressing as well  the mozzarella cheese at least was fresh and delicious but that was about it  overall it was fine and i would recommend trying the pizza that looked delicious but im not sure id go againbon a recent visit to phoenix my foodie son begged for us to eat at amys  despite being aware of the bad press in the past we were committed to giving the place a fair shot  all i can say is thank goodness we ate there the place is beautiful  sammy served us and was very attentive admittedly we went at a quiet hour right before closing  the four of us ordered a bunch of different dishes  everything tasted great from the soups pastas sandwiches  the hummus and home made bread was especially out of this world delicious  i am not usually a dessert lover but i must say that the chocolate peanut butter cake was probably the best dessert i have ever had  we had a lovely conversation with sammy who then introduced us to amy upon my sons star struck request  amy was gracious and friendly and her kitchen is immaculate  my younger son now follows amy on twitter  the couple could not have been nicer the food couldnt have been better and the restaurant couldnt have been more beautiful  too bad we didnt have enough time to go back again  shame on you gordon ramsaybbeautiful restaurant in a strip mall very friendly  excellent pizza  we will be back to try the rest of the menubplease do not eat here i had lunch with a friend then my husband joined us but we left and he stayed and finished we had already paid and told my husband just to pay for his food they charged him for our food as well thinking we didnt have the conversation that we had paid long story short  after threatening to call the police they are ruthless and who knows what they do to your food just dont bover priced for cheap quality food that they serve you can feel the tension when you walk in the place not a good feeling specially if you wanna have a relaxing dinner and the tension isnt from the customer because know one wasnt therebi went in with a completely open mind hoping that all this media hype was false nnlet me start by saying the staff waitress  other staff were really personable and very attentive our drinks were constantly being refilled and they checked back with the table at regular intervals to make sure we had everything we needed nni was a little apprehensive to try a full meal as the prices were a little expensive i cannot speak to the quality of the entrees we did however try an appetizer and two desserts  nnappetizer  artichoke jalapexcxbo cream cheese with herb flat breadnthe flat bread was crispy and flavorful the dip was served cold i think it was supposed to be cold but it didnt say that on the menu the jalapexcxbos where in a bunch on the side of the dip and required mixing the combo of the bread and the dip was decent it didnt knock my socks off but it had okay flavor nndesserts  key lime pie  chocolate mousse torte nthe key lime filling tasted good the crumb crust was slightly burnt the crust ruined the pie for me nthe chocolate mousse torte i think that is what it was called was not bad at all it was a little overpriced at  but  it was the best thing we ate that eveningnnwe didnt see any craziness from the owners while we ate and the place was pretty busy in summary the food wasnt great but not horrible either the prices were a little on the expensive side so be prepared for that if you go for the full meal deal nnfyi to folks wsmall children we had no trouble coming in with a stroller  but when we went to leave we were ushered out the back door they cannot accommodate a stroller going between the tables when the restaurant is crowdedbi had a sweet tooth today and as i was checking out restaurants i came crossed amys so i went to her website their desserts look so good i thought i drive down and pick one up   the desserts they have look amazing so i bought two pieces of cake which were delicious   somewhat expensive but well worth it    i was with my son and we didnt have time to sit down and eat but he wanted to go back and actually try one of their meals  the place was absolutely spotless   a very feminine looking restaurant the owners were there and were very nice   one of the reasons i want to go back is because they had an interesting menu and the place was so clean im dying to try a pear salad   maybe tomorrowbi see that yelp is reporting that amys is closed  i have no idea if that is true or not because i am like  weeks late on writing my review  the website still seems to be working so i am just going to assume that they are still open and write my review anyway  as i said my visit was about  weeks ago  yes i admit i totally came because of all the craziness and controversy surrounding this place and i wanted to check it out and see what was what  the visit was interesting  the shopping center was busy and it was hard to find a spot but we did and were surprised to find that amys was mostly empty  sammy was behind the counter and said something about how they were about to close but they would help us anyway  i asked about the different cakes and desserts behind the counter and he wasnt sure so he called amy over to help us  i was pretty excited  amy was very nice and explained each of the different items  we chose two different pieces of cake and took them to go  the restaurant is kinda nice but also weird due to all of the cat stuff everywhere  the cakes were both really good but for  a slice it was a little much  i can get a crazy huge and yummy cake at costco for bwent to arizona for a guys golf trip and tried this restaurant nnactually desserts are surprisingly really good not sure if they order it in or prepare inhouse but it doesnt matter they were really tastynnthe entrees thats another issue in itself i am giving it two stars because the gnocchi was nasty but then again this place isnt called amys pasta company its amys baking companynni say only come for coffee and dessert and you will have a  start experiencebnothing to write home about  dessert was considerably better than their entrees but since it is called amys baking company maybe that is to be expected i was surprised that my friend and i were the only diners as it was prime time but i did feel their entrxcxaes  because they werent very good  were overpriced their desserts which admittedly were very good i felt were way overpriced the desserts at chompis and ajs are just as good and much less expensive if i was looking for a meal id probably opt for pita jungle which also serves sandwiches and soups that are just as good but at a much more reasonable price  but i might consider going back for a dessert this place may be pricey but you dont have to battle crowds as they dont seem to have developed a following yet  especially handy if youre trying to make a movie next doorbthis place is horrible the food is mediocre at best and the atmosphere is miserable lets not even get started with the oldtimer running the placebin honesty i probably would have given amys four stars i dont just hand out five willynilly but i feel like i should offset the bad reviews given by people whove never actually eaten herennthat said i also must admit that i came with my friend because we loved the kitchen nightmare episode but during our two hours there were nothing like what i saw on tv although i only saw amy in passing sammy was super kind and gracious i actually felt bad because he looked so stressed out when we walked in yet the moment he noticed us he put on his game face and acted exactly like a wonderful host would he went above and beyond to make sure that my buddy and i were having a great experience nnempathy aside the most important aspect of any restaurant experience is obviously the foodand man oh man was it good we split the hummus which is served with flat bread and all i can say is delish the bread came out warm and soft and well seasoned and as odd as this sounds i was impressed that the bread didnt get stale in  minutes like most flat breads do and the hummus was definitely freshamy even sprinkles whole garbanzo beans on the top im disappointed that i didnt get to try the cheese and prosciutto panini because seriously you guys prosciutto is the bomb but my buddy was getting full and we had to order dessert obvi again no disappointments there the desserts were beautiful but more importantly they tasted excellent my only complaint is that the desserts are pretty pricey i have to add that sammy was sure to let me know how much they cost so i in no way felt cheated im sure the price reflects the precision and labor that goes into making them so aesthetic my friends had glitter on it but i guess the way i see it fancy looking desserts are like nice lingerietheres really no point because youre not going to look at it for more than five seconds anywaynnin conclusion its time to lift the ban on amysbcustomer service is poor  food is ok but not great  the food is definitely overpriced for the quality you are receiving  i would venture to say that many of the folks in there are new customers  with very few of them coming back  i ate at abc with a few friends visiting from italy and spain  they laughed at the pizza tastequality  so abc has that going for themnnparking at night kind of sucks just like most of the deserts and meals we triedbyuck we just moved to the area and were looking for new restaurants this place was a mistake hummus had a very strange texture and despite being called cilantro hummus there was no flavornnmy husband had the blue cheese burger was way too greasy under cooked and just tasted off bbg chicken mango pizza we had with avacado the avacado was mushy and old we tried to send the pizza back but were treated with disrespect in a shocking manner we paid and left never againbim really dabbling between one and two stars on this one of course my boyfriend and i were drawn in because of gordon ramsays kitchen nightmares unfortunately we didnt experience any screaming battles employee walk outs or any of amys or samis crazy fits however the food was terrible and the service was more than awkward nnwe walked in and the place is actually decorated pretty well but the decor is overshadowed by loud music playing the music is the awkwardly exoticsounding music you hear at cheap massage places or at an asian nail parlor also when we walked in there were like three girl servers just standing at the door that were staring at us through the glass doors before we went in terrible atmosphere super awkwardnnwe initially went in to have dessert but were intrigued to see if the food really was as bad as it was on the show so we sat and had dinner our waitress sat us down and was very hovery she gave us about  minute to look over the menu before asking us what we wanted we had to tell her twice that we were still looking feeling rushed we ordered the three meatball appetizer i got the pesto potato gnocchi and my boyfriend got the greek salad with chicken she took our order and came back shortly with our two diet cokes and shortly after the meatballs nnthe meatballs came out and they literally smelled like dog food the kind of dog food that is a gelatinous mess of emulsified unmentionables that keeps its shape when it comes out of the can not to mention they were about the diameter of a quarter three quartersized meatballs for five dollars absolutely ridiculous upon taking a bit they were absolutely charred and overcooked to the point that there was a black crust on the outside of them they tasted pretty much like unseasoned overcooked ground beef not too appetizing the whole time we were eating the nasty meatballs amy came out of the kitchen and was seriously staring at us from behind the counter the whole timennnot much later our entrees came out they brought my boyfriends salad which didnt have the chicken on it excited to get a moment to complain he called the waitress over but she had a bowl of greasy chicken nibletts in it and she pretty much just placed in on our table i though it was weird that the freshly grilled chicken came out in a separate bowl smothered in grease as if it were pan fried or sauteed the greek salad literally tasted like a mix of playdoh and chemicals the lettuce was crisp and fresh but the olives were really disgusting and were what gave the salad the playdoh taste the salad dressing made it taste like turpentine nnmy food was definitely much more awkward my pesto potato gnocchi came out as the tomato basil gnocchi but im not the type even at a good restaurant to send things back anyhow i ate it and upon chewing the gnocchi it stuck to the inside of my mouth like a dog with peanut butter they were slimy and pretty large so it literally felt like there were rubber balls in my mouth the sauce was as bland as could be and didnt even taste like tomato and basil whatever nnwhen the waitress came back a million times to ask how it was of course we said great to avoid and flare ups we said the same thing when sami the owner came by as well we decided to try dessert as it was the only thing chef ramsay said was even edible we got a super tiny flourless chocolate cake it was good but it was definitely not worth  nnthe bill came to  dollars absolutely not worth it when we got the bill sami stared at us until we signed the check and added a tip i was really inclined to not add a tip however with him awkwardly staring it got the job done the meal was terrible and the service was awkward and subpar it was an interesting expereince but no we probably wont ever be back nnpictures of our food are availablebof course this restaurant was a must visit after their kitchen nightmares implosion and upon arriving tried to keep an open mind all in all our experience was quite lacking the restaurant was cold and unfriendly everyone on staff seemed to be on edge but we ordered french onion soup and hummus to start though the food came in a timely manner the hummus was watery and both were lacking in seasoning we ordered a specialty pizza which was undercooked and a burger that was not cooked to order and was bland the only saving grace delicious desserts if you must go for a show or out of crazy catlady curiosity just do the dessert takeout and save the money rest assured you can make your own dinner better at homebi was visiting family in the area a few weeks ago from chicago and made sure that they took me here admittedly out of curiosity after seeing abc on kitchen nightmares  we stopped by to pick up dessert to go picking out the candy bar torte and key lime pie  sami greeted us right away and chatted for a bit and seemed perfectly pleasant at least towards us anyway  he was actually the one who brought up tv and gordon ramsay out of nowhere as i was trying to play it coolnot sure if he was just being honest and up front or just proud of the publicity and attention even if it has been largely negative  we didnt talk to amy but i did see her through the kitchen door and her touch was evident throughout the dessert case with the little chocolate meow tags topping many of the dessertsnnin regards to the desserts themselves they were good but not necessarily amazing  and i am glad i love glitter considering that their dessert case has more edible glitter than a gay pride parade  all in all im glad i got the chance to stop by and id be willing to give it another shot this time to have an opportunity to dine in and eat an actual meal sami recommends the pizza not just dessertbthis place should just stick to baking all there stuff is beautiful and tasty however there food is dull and tasteless the worse part of this place are the owners just rude and in denial clearly they have no idea what customer services means its a shame they should just stick to the baking which is amazingbthis was definitely a more of a pay for the experience type of placenthe food was not great way overly priced and my bread was stale nthe dining area is beautifully decorated  thats about itbive been to amys twice now  i admiti first went to see the train wreck  both times i have been pleasantly surprised  the last time i shared a piece of key lime pie with a friend and it was absolutely amazing  both samy and amy were there and were very friendly  next time i am down to see a movie we will go for dinnerbthis place was absolutely the opposite of what the negative people try to portray it as sammy is just the most welcoming person ever and they even play along with the bad rep given to them while interacting with their customers got to meet both of them and will definitely be recommending it to others dont listen to the trolls go for yourselves peoplebare we really doing this that was my thought as i parked my car a bunch of us were getting together for a friends going away and it was decided to have it at amys baking company ill preface this by saying that i hadnt heard about amys until it made the news after the whole gordon ramsay debacle nnso after playing catch up and fulling understanding the buzz it was with more than a little trepidation that i walked through the door i immediately liked the atmosphere and the music they were playingnni was welcomed by our server debbie and ordered the bleu ribbon burger while my meal was being prepared we were well looked after by the staff who made sure that our water and sodas were fullnnwhen my bleu ribbon burger arrived it was huge cooked up a perfect medium rare topped with bleu cheese and bits of bacon with a home made bun that was heavenly the bun was actually a little too big but it was so good that i had to make the choice of finishing off the bun or trying to save room for dessert i opted for plan bnnthis is the same burger that gordon ramsay trashed which i saw on you tube so unless these guys completely changed up the preparation of this item i honestly dont know what mrramsay was flipping out about it came with a nice side salad and i got a side of fries which were good i really enoyed it and it was a lot of foodnntheir dessert display is very impressive and everything looks delicious while my favorite key lime pie of all time is still chelseas kitchen these guys serve up a good too i also got to try their mousse which was delicious and their candy bar pie or cake not sure i think i was slipping into a diabetic coma at this point was eyes roll back in your head goodnnthe staff were all very welcoming and gracious and sammy made sure we were enjoying everything and they were absolute saints for splitting our bill  ways so this really was an enjoyable night and i think everyone in our group was very pleasantly surprised  i have to to admit that after reading the reviews and hearing all of the chatter i didnt know what i was in for but i had a great meal and experience and would not hesitate to come back here again if i were in the areabi was in town and it was my birthday its not a birthday without cake and i remembered the dessert case from the show so i stopped in to grab a slice of cake to go the decor was absolutely adorable and set a great ambiance i wish id had time to stay and eat but i had to run with my slice of cake sami the owner was very nice and personal although very busy no one can say they dont work hard i got my slice of chocolate dipped cheesecake and later devoured it in my hotel room it was wonderful the next time im in town i intend to stay for a meal and soak in the whole bistro experience sami said im welcome to come back anytime and i believe itbnice family owned establishment with a panmediterranean menu  had the fpuzza with fig pear prosciutto and gorgonzola  tasty although a bit heavy on the rosemary  very enthusiastic owner who takes care of the front of the house  dont be dissuaded by the strip mall location  misters on the patiobthe food sucks place smells like a garbage disposal do yourself a favor and go somewhere elsebi went to amys baking company with my parents and boyfriend yesterday afternoon we was amazed samy was a great host and amy was kind enough to come out and meet us we were welcomed into the restaurant as intimately as if it had been their home the restaurant was beautiful drippy candles family photos classic decor and enya playing on the stereo contributing to the ethereal atmosphere my mom mentioned if i had my own restaurant id want it to look and feel just like this nnthe food was exquisite yet simple we all enjoyed salads and two appetizers the hummus and flatbread and the artichoke dip with flatbreadthe service was also impeccable warm and inviting the dessert we got was a glutenfree chocolate mouse cake delicious nnthis restaurant is wonderful and deserves a much higher rating than it currently holds the scottsdale community should support this business and anyone from out of town needs to come check it out and decide their own opinion and not allow social media to decide for them nnthis restaurant has been misrepresented a lot of care goes into the food and ambiance give abc a chancebwe went to amys baking company for lunch and found that they only have dessert foods we ordered two different pieces of cake and soda they had soda by the can no fountain but sam waited on us and was very pleasant n he said that at the end of the month the place is being sold and he and his wife will only sell dessets thru tomasos restaurants n  the cake was delicious and sammy was very pleasant and nice to us there was a steady flow of customers and they all seemed to love the desserts sam said someone from france buying the location but did not say what kind of restaurant or food would be servedbmy wife and i have always enjoyed amys wonderful desserts and sammy has always been attentive and nice  however we went there tonight and noticed they remade the menu with the most amazing appetizers and sandwiches  the service was outstanding and we enjoyed the artichoke dip with bread made with jalapexcxbos peppers panini sandwiches bruchutto brie cheese and apple infused spread and a beautiful egg salad with truffle oil  our friend who was with us is a gourmet trained chef and had nothing but praise  to top off the night we tried their still amazing desserts a vanilla bean pie with lemon topping and the flourless peanut butter chocolate cake with ganoch chocolate  all of it for a very affordable price  everyone needs to stop watching and commenting about the show and actually experience the hard work sammy and amy have put into redoing the restaurant  amazing food great service and at new affordable prices  people need to give these owners another chance and actually try the outstanding food  wow is all i have to say  the deserts are still the best in town by farbthis was my first time back in quite a while we stopped in to get some deserts to go my friend and our children enjoyed looking at the amazing items in their pastry counter although they are pricey their deserts are all made in house and are stunning samy was very friendly and helpful as well as patient with our  children nwhen we got home we split a variety of items with our families key lime pie giant chocolate dipped macaroon eclair flourless chocolate cake and the individual chocolate covered pumpkin cheesecake am i forgetting anything they were all amazing and we really enjoyed the tasting we had each one tasted as good as it lookedbstill a loyal fanwent there tonight for desserts and expresso  they were once again pretty packed  we had the cream brulee which is always great and one of our favorites every week amy makes a new dessert and this week we had the white chocolate coconut cream tart which was not at all sweet and very good  plus the french pressed decaf coffee with soft velvety cream was awesome  they also make the best white pizza  i am not a real fan of ricotta cheese and they have an awesome white pizza with goat cheese so we ordered a large one to go and it was great as usual    both samy and amy are wonderful and allie did a great job waiting on us  they do a big business when the harkins movies let out and sometimes they are very crowded you can not find a seat but samy will set up a table just for you so you do not have to wait outside in the cold  he takes care of his customers and they both have a great heart  go see them you will be amazed how wonderful they are and how wonderful their food isfoodies and yelpers if you really believe everything you see on tvyou are pretty stupidmaybe all you folks you have never been to abc and write negative posts can fuss up and get a real lifebhorrible service and food cant believe this place is still openbworst restaurant experience i went to eat here when i was driving thru for a photoshoot i was doing downtown i ordered a pizza and my assistant ordered a burger we both can say it was the worst food i have ever eaten because of the meat quality and the dough quality simply the worst service from amy toobi stopped in to pick up a dessert for a special occasion one afternoon sammy was extremely nice he was helpful and i will return for a meal another time the dessert was amazing the best we have ever hadbhad lunch this week with some friends  one i have not seen in  years the service was great and the food delicious seriously save room for dessert you will not be disappointed  the lemon meringue was oh so yummy amy does a great job  will be back if i ever get back that waybi was in arizona visiting friends i thought it would be fun to visit amys baking company we ordered a simple sausage and pepperoni pizza some ordered salad and one ordered a burger as for the pizza we should have ordered from dominoes the salads tasted like it came from a salad bar and the burger was horrible the only thing that was good was the desserts dont waste you time or money going for dinner get fast food and pick up desserts here on the way homebid put zero stars if it was an option the food was horrible the atmosphere was tense and the owner some older guy was rude when asked how much longer it would be after waiting well over an hour for a burger and a salad ndo not bother wasting your money here there are many other better options in scottsdalebsurprisingly great visit  i took my stepdaughter last weekend and we had a great time  sami was a wonderful host and his wife was gracious  i will encourage my husband to take me back for datenightbgood news is i had a good key lime pie bad news is i called in for a peach pie and they told me they had one when i got there he handed me a peach tart i ended up going with a key lime pie because of last minute timing the key lime pie was over  just thought everyone should know since i only found out when he handed me the receiptbi ate here yesterday i waited  minutes for a great pizza i saw the guy at the front counter stealing tips so i gave mine straight to the waitress she looked scared and tucked it quickly into her apron i wanted to tell management  but had too many other things to take care of the desserts look pretty so they get an extra starbhonestly had a great time at amys baking company vs our visit at gordon ramsay restaurant located in las vegas see review we went on a friday greeted nicely bye our server and sammy we had the pear salad witch had amazing caramelized pecans those are worth the salad alone please keep on the menu we had  mains between the  of us the gnocchi was really good nice flavor and taste to the sauce the fettuccini alfredo sauce was really good and father had spaghetti and meatballs witch looked good honestly i didnt want to mention anything about the show and come on a open mind witch i think everyone should when eating out and not eating at chains rather then small business witch we should support we met amy and sammy and its nice to see owners actually coming out and greeting guest i know its hard to especially having owned one ourselves we went on a friday small crowd in and out under  hr tops i wish i could say that we had the same experience at gordons however i highly recommend checking out this place and giving it a chance try on slow time during weekend trade depending on how fast you need to be in and out weather catching a show at the movies or shopping locally we all need to support small business owners i know arizona restaurant week is coming at least make a attempt to check it out  thanks for the great meal amy and sammybhonestly the desserts were all we tried but they were to die for and i have been craving the key lime pie and coconut cream cake since my visit last week namy was super sweet and had a great talk with my little one nupdatejust saw the show for the first time so dont hold it against me i went in open and the dessert was goodbvisited some friends in scotsdale this place is a pos ate the salmon burger and got food poisoning contacted the health department save money go eat fast foodbwe ate there today for the first time  and it was wonderful samy gave us great service amy gave us great food we had pita bread and hummus and salads give them a try i really think gordon ramsey got this one wrong this was not a kitchen nightmare but a kitchen paradisebwe went for dessert on a saturday night  the key lime pie was delicious complete with small slices of keylime  the chocolate and peanut cake was good but so rich i had trouble finishing my slice  there is a gluten free option but what would be the point of dessertnnsammy was a nice guy and treated us well  the restaurant was clean and well kept  there were only a few other patrons in the placebamazing food amazing people a must to allnndessert out of this world and the special ice coffeenomg out of this worldlove itbthe minute i read boulangerie my imagination fliesso we went to check their desserts and the sparkling decoration should have been enough to avoid any temptation nni made the mistake to order a white chocolate coconut pieterrible i dont like to bake but i can prepare something more tasteful this was a get together of lots of sugar and not any definition of flavor compared to a citrone tarte from a boulangerie in seattlethis was a pooor pooor performancennon the other hand my friend ordered a crxcxame brxcxbblxcxae now this one was very very decent i should have gone with something like that surprisingly a lady came to inspect our deserts and complained she was not allowed to have desert unless she had food first really hahahha or was she just out of her mindbive thrown up better pizza this pizza is just bland and awful and should not be sold to anyone who is currently not in prisonbi tried this restaurant with my husband and another couple after watching gordon ramseys show expecting the worst we went there mostly for entertainment and not great food we were pleasantly surprised the herbed flat bread was delicious and only   a great value all of our meals were delicious sammy was super attentive and welcoming amy came out once to a table by us to fix an issue with their food both were nice and our server was very nice too we would go backbthis was neither the best or worst dining experience i have had i am a restauranteur with three restaurants italian greek and a steakhouse pub in the second largest city in our state i am a cia trained chef and have a ba in hospitality managementsuffice it to say i know food and i know the restaurant business having worked in the industry  yearsnnthe wait staff were pleasant and engaging samy stopped by to touch base with us once before the entrxcxaes were served it was my wife and i and once during the meal the salads and entrxcxaes while neither excellent nor horrible were merely adequate we did not find ourselves engaged in any drama but did witness an episode of what i would call poor customer service between samy and a party of three diners two tables away i have dealt with customers who definitely were not always right in my time but have always managed a gracious conclusion by comping drinks or sometimes eating the whole check just to bring the exchange to a close that is a builtin cost of any successful restaurant unfortunately should they try again for a reservation we are usually too booked to accommodate themany dayany timenni must admit the desserts were tasty if i could fly them in freshly i would put a few of them in my own italian and steakhouse restaurantsnnso in summarythe food rates a  salads and entrees   desserts a solid  the wait staff a solid  the ambiance aka floor show a  the service flow and wait times a  this averages to a  and although we did have spotty silverware hey it happens the dining room was airy aromatic and clean this was definitely worth  stars as such  stars it iswe would return to try it for ourselves but would not make it our first recommendation for european dining in scottsdalebthe food is as bad as the fake vibe which is as bad as the owners personalities i cannot believe they are still in businessbthe desserts are to die for the pizza isnt the best ive ever had but it was decent but the key lime pieperfectobthe only positive thing i can say about this place is the interior decor that being said its basically the old saying would you rather eat a turd sandwich in the dining room or just eat straight from the outhouse hole either way its still crapbso as promised we went back and the service was great sammy talked a lot about showing gordan ramsay wrong although it seemed it lite a fire under them we will be going back  maybe this was a lucky night the dip was amazing i loved my pasta the only thing we had an issue with we went at pm and a sign on the door said will reopen at pm  this was much better then our first visitba little pricy but i was very content with the quality of the food i ordered the pear salad the food was actually tasty the pear added a smooth alternate to the usual apple i have with a salad the dressing was excellent and i believe there was a drizzle of chocolate unusual but tasty nnthe portion size seemed approximate to what youd expect for lunch the delivery time was appropriately speedy it was a salad with no cooked parts but they did well with respect to that the presentation was appetizing nnsammy did bring by a pizza which gordon famously criticized sammy announced that it looked great which is a little unusual but the fact he said it make the experience a little more surreal omg thats where gordon sat theres the register etc he acted as host and delivered the check a waitress took our order and delivered the food nni tipped  hoping that it found the appropriate home i am usually generous with my tipping anyway nnoverall the experience of what happened on the show still kind of exists but the food we ordered was pretty tasty and passed the tests of my layman taste buds nnid return againbfabulous  great service  huge portions  we brought special friendsnfor a birthday dinner  we were so proud to introduce them to this fine food  they said theyll be back soon and so will we  nnwish wed had room for dessert  the pastries are out of this worldbi visited out of curiosity while i didnt witness any theatrics and i didnt experience any adverse service i found the food lackluster seasoning was non existent and grease was plentiful the pizza my fiance ordered while crisp and cooked thoroughly was bland and uneventful i didnt care to order dessert thank you for being friendly and welcoming but i wouldnt recommend the food three stars for servicebmy wife insisted we stop by for dessert because of the hype after eating across the street at fate  as fate would have it the place was fairly empty so we thought lets give it a shot  while we were waiting sammy started yelling at the table next to us and we noticed fruit flies on the desserts  we then politely told the waitress thanks but no thanks drove to sweet republic for a nice ice cream insteadba wonderful little bistro near the movie theatres serving great pasta and deeelicious pastriesnand and and the most beautiful chef in scottsdalebvisiting some friends in az and we decided to pull over and grab some food we initially stopped to grab some gelato but upon deciding we were hungrier thought we would grab a bite and get some gelato for after nntorn between the pita place and amys baking company i won the vote to head into amys sometimes winning the vote is not a good thingnnmoment we stepped inside the service was instantly poor sat ourselves down and waited and waited til we got some menus then waited and waited for them to take a drinks order normally i wouldnt be as fussy but az is freaking hot so i need my fluids mannni ordered the margarita pizza as i love pizza and like to try it in as many different places i can this unfortunately was a let down my wife didnt even finish her meal of insalata caprese salad due to its unfresh tastennvery underwhelming overall experience and simple things like good service refills even bread to chew on while you wait for your meal which also took a ridiculously long time to make its way to us after waiting ages to give our order were overlooked charge extra for bread come onnnif i was local i wouldnt frequent this place and next time my vote will go to pita junglebaweful food terrible service i dont recommend this to anyone  nnthe food is bland and tasted like it was microwavedbterrible food terrible service deeply suspect that the owners had their family fake good reviewsbi was in scottsdale on business and decided to give this place a try ordered the blue ribbon burger i nearly puked it was like a wet sponge soaked in grease owners were rude and obnoxious when i complained never againbif you are going for dinnerbring some snacks with you the service is so poor you might pass out before you get your order that is if you get what you ordered id like to comment on the food but after waiting  hour and  minutes i left very rude owner said they had a computer failure and orders were delayed but people seated after us got their order they felt sorry for us and offered some of their pizza however they said it was not goodbthis place has some really good wellcrafted food   tucked back in the scottsdaleshea shopping center in between the gelato spot  the amc theatre isnt a place youd really expect to find a good patisserie boulangerie but there you have it  nnthey have a way of taking normal things like a tukey sandwich by taking real thick sliced turkey adding mascarpone cranberry chutney and dried cherries or a ham sandwich well prosciutto with brie  granny smith apples and making them taste extravagant  nnthey also have a wide selection of very fancy if not pricey selections from the bakery   nnbe prepared this place isnt cheap the only reason i give it  not  stars  its  for the above mentioned sandwiches which also include a side salad  fries errr pommes fritesbdrove all the way here from phoenix with two of my coworkersni honestly love this place sammy was super friendly and helpful and immediately offered us drinks i got the ham and cheese panini and it came with a salad both the salad and the panini were delicious i would recommend this place to anyone its a wonderful restaurant with great service and awesome food amy and sammy were laughing and joking with us by the end of the night i will definitely be coming back herebi give them  stars because their desserts are pretty good i personally met sammy and amy both tonight they were very nice and i commend them for going through what they did and still sticking it through it was actually pretty busy and they provided impeccable service i had a chai tea latte and my friend wanted a dirty chai tea latte which they do not have on their menu sammy asked what a dirty chai tea latte was and went out of his way to make him one very nice of him they were very friendly and welcomingbwould give  stars if i could  owners are extremely rude  my burger was as wet as a soaked sponge tried to send it back and old man said i was wrong and when he got to the kitchen the crazy lady that calls herself a chef said i dont know what good food is  do not eat here i have never seen such chaos in a restaraunt  server girl was nice but left a cash tip and watched old man put the tip in his pocket what kind of owner steals from their people wow unbelievable  please close your doorsbworst pizza you will ever have do not go here the dough was not cooked and amy is crazy she came out of the kitchen just to yell at me what a nut jobbi have been to amys a few times over the last few months and i have to disagree with some of the reviews on here ill sum up my experiences upon meeting amy samy and their food first off amy and samy couldnt have been nicer each time i went in for food i was blown away yes i was curious about meeting them after watching the show but the truth is that they couldnt have been nicer the food is as good as it looks the restaurant itself is immaculate ive seen amy herself cleaning up mopping the floor you could eat off this floor  i have tried the infamous blue ribbon burger  asparagus pizza and their desserts amazing amys key lime pie is delicious tastes like no other just to show you im not completely biased i had the hummus and it was good not crazy about it but it was good but her presentation of all of her food looks great does the food take long a little but do you want food that looks and tastes like crap or food that looks and tastes great abc reminds me of why we go out to eat in the first place great food and good times to spend with family and friends first time in awhile that i wasnt asking to use their wifi overall great experience and definitely a supporter for as long as youll have usbsome of the worst food ever when i complained about my undercooked pizza i was told to leave im sorry that i dont like my pizza uncooked on the bright side its really clean inside  if you want bad food and crazy people go try itbnasty food and terrible service the owner is nuts and i am glad i did not pay for any of that crap there was a piece of hair in my pizza and the desserts looked store bought we got our food and once we saw how bad it was we left we ended up going to mcdonalds for dinnerbmy sweet friend and i decided to give it a try for lunch we had what i would explain as an interesting experience involving customer service the good news was that samy did rectify it quickly and then offered my friend and i complimentary cappuccinos following our lunch and the best news was that we really enjoyed our food i had the pear salad and added chicken my friend had the tuna salad i have definitely been entertained by reading these yelp reviews and considering all of that i will be back as i really want to support local businessesba wonderful neighborhood secret  an excellent and wide selection of foods with a mediterranean inspiration  very nice wine and beer selection with friendly prices  deserts are to die for  the name of amys baking company is real  and deserts are amys passion  the owners are here every day  a scottsdale mustbthis was my third time to visit abc in  months i have received outstanding quality food and service each visit to the restaurant for all the haters dont knock something until you try it for yourself and learn more about the reality of the situation nnmy friends and i ordered the red pepper hummus with pita bread for an appetizer  like we do each time we visit it was amazing as usual we then ordered the garlic chicken pizza without the mushrooms the pizza was cooked to perfection and my tastebuds were delighted and what is a visit to amys without getting one of her homemade desserts we got a creme brulee and savored each bite we took nni would recommend abc to anyone looking for a nice restaurant to eat at with great food for an amazing price and great quality service and if youre in the area late after dinner and are craving something sweet do stop in and enjoy one of amys desserts you wont be disappointedbi dont write many reviews but i feel compelled to do so for abc  this is an excellent restaurant  beautiful quaint and charming  sam is gracious and considerate  i was on an obvious first date and sam was very attentive   when my dates credit card had issues he was as considerate as possible knowing it was a potentially embarrassing situation  nall of the customer service aside the food was good  i had the hummus appetizer very good and the flourless chocolate cake also very good  ndo not pay attention to the  star reviews they are obviously trolls  because there is no way they deserve a one star  go for yourself and make that decision yourself nim looking forward to going again and trying more of their menubthe food is actually really good i think the pricing is really reasonable too but in the four times my wife and i have eaten here the guy who runs the dining room has been rude to us twice it truly is a shame because courteous service seems like it should be the simplest component of a restaurant but abc struggles with itnnthe first time we just came in to get a dessert to go they were busy the guy told us they could not serve us that is to say i could not hand him cash in exchange for a slice of cake in a box and walk away that was evidently going to be too much hassle i was puzzled but i thought maybe it was a little quaint that he has such a high standard of service for his dine in customers that he refuses to compromise for someone who isnt staying there my wife and i were annoyed but also a little intrigued so we eventually gave them another shot nnour next two experiences were quite goodnnour last experience we brought our two year old son to have an early dinner at  we know not everybody loves kids ergo the  dinner time a conscious effort to minimize our footprint on the dining public this was  so it was a little chilly outside but sunny we requested a table outside since the weather was bearable and we knew out there we would bother no one the guy insisted we sit inside since it was too cold out there were only two other customers in the dining room i played a youtube video on my phone to entertain our two year old as we waited for our food the guy was not pleased at this and responded by turning up the music in the dining room im thinking eh no big deal he then came to the table and informed us that if we had come during the dinner rush he would have declined to seat us gesturing towards my son now he has actually changed my frame of mind tthat is a big dealnnas a parent im not having that if youre a restauranteur and you make a calculated decision to not welcome parents with kids hey thats your prerogative but if youre a parent you should know what youre walking into so parents even if you show up at an odd time and request to be seated outside away from the other patrons they dont want you there nnbottom line if you are their kind of customer you will probably enjoy this place you can tell he has a very old world notion of fine dining into which he is fashioning his place my personal preference is to be treated well when im spending my money and i am not trying to be anybodys certain kind of clientele i thought we made an effort to be courteous diners and they made an effort to make us feel unwelcomebi have been to amys baking company twice with my fiancxcxa  the inside looks very nice and really clean i have had full on conversations with both amy and sammy and joked around with them they were both really nice to us nnthe food was really good also i got the cheese panini and my fiancxcxa got the spaghetti with tomato and basil both dished were really good the prices for the items on the menu were very reasonable as well on a side note though  it is  for a slice of cake the cake is good but i dont think justifiably  good  overall our experiences were really good we will definitely be going back there for lunch occasionallybtruly disgusting watching kitchen nightmares reminded me to write my experience with abc last year around october i was visiting az on a business trip and went into this place not having heard anything about it before the place looked fantastic and the hostowner seemed friendly at first the waitress was nice too and warned us about possibly having to wait for our food even though the place was practically empty nmy pasta came in almost an hour later while my mates food was nowhere to be found ill be honest my pasta tasted finenothing special but it was decent my friends meal comes in well after an hour and a half and it was apparently cold and peppery when he tried to send it back the owner came to enquire about the issue and took it back at this point we didnt wanna wait another hour for his food and wanted to leave and then things got ugly the owner demanded we pay for the food we returned or wait and when we refused he was rude and obnoxious after a bit of back and forth we got our way but not before they said we werent welcome back in their restaurant nafter watching the episode i feel like we actually got treated quite well compared to their other customers and i wouldnt go back there even if their food was brilliantbfirst samy delivered some two beautiful plates of food some breathtaking tapenade and some truly epic lemon garlic hummus and amys fresh made herb flat bread the bread was warm and delicious with just the right amount of crunch  chew topped off with a hummus that had a real lemon zing to it was a perfect way to wake up our palatesnnnext we were presented with a spicy asian chicken salad that was fresh crunchy and had just the right amount of spicy goodness to really get our mouths watering as a contrast to the spicy salad we were also treated to a baby arugula and pear salad this was one of the highlights of the night for me samy and amy have hit a home run of babe ruth like proportions with this salad the fresh pear dried cranberries and honey citrus dressing danced on our tastebuds like sweet bursts of flavored sunlight i try not to over embellish but i was almost mad that i had to share this salad with the other guests at our tablennamy had spent the day handmaking pasta for our dinner of papperdalle with videos on instagram to prove it which came with either a rich and savory bolognese sauce or a light creamy pesto this was the first time i had ever experienced pasta that didnt come from a box and ive  got to tell you that it was earth shattering the taste is completely different and i know it was a truly remarkable dish because i couldnt stop smiling as i ate itnnwe ended the night with coffee  dessert which if you dont know is where amy is a real super star with a multitude of options and an endless supply of cakes pies and confectionery delights we wrapped up what was extraordinarily memorable eveningbmy girlfriends and i walked in for the first time and we had an excellent experience i wasnt sure what the fuss and the negativity was all about other than some bad publicity from a reality show but as a customer all i care about is great food and service we ordered spaghetti caprese salad and the fig pear proscuitto pizza all were absolutely delicious plus the owner who was also our server was very attentive and respectful toward us even when we were clearly done eating with my leftover pizza in a box he refrained from bringing us the check right away seeing that my friends and i were in a deep conversation i love this kind of  personal service that enhances your total dining experience next time i will be bringing my husband in for a date night and trying one of their amazing desserts as well as other menu itemsbi was looking for a birthday cake or considering sprinkles but saw amys on my yelp search for bakeries and thought id give it a try   oh my my my   rather than purchase an entire cake which was more than needed amy kindly suggested that i try a sampling of desserts and what a perfect solution it was   nni ordered two of the gorgeous heart shaped flourless chocolate cake a slice of super moist pineapple cake a small lemon meringue pie  a few tiny key lime tarts and a slice of carrot cake   and how much fun did we have digging in and sampling each of these spectacular delights  lots of fun thats how much   that was hands down the best dessert sampler i have ever had and my guests agreed   everyone had to find out where to find amys   nnthe service was super good  samy was friendly and helpful and although evidently quite busy amy made sure i was happy and came to check on my selection which was very thoughtful of her  nnmy only confusion is why that place wasnt busier  there was one table seated and the patrons were raving about how delicious their food was  i see other similar reviews so why isnt that place busting at the seams   give them a shot it will be worth your while i promise   when you go i hope you try the pineapple cake if its available  it was one of the most interesting and delicious desserts ive ever experienced so tender and moist such complex flavors and not super sweet just right  nngo amy you are a starbwent in with an open mind was very impressed with the food had the sweet and spicy pasta rustica and my fiance had the gnocchi with basil she loved it sammy was very friendly  didnt get to meet amy  must say it was nothing like what was on kitchen nightmares they must have changed the menu if the food was the same when the show was filmed i must say i have a different outlook on ramsay huge fan cause there was nothing wrong with the food nnwill be definitely going back highly recommendbthe one time i tried to eat there we drove  min out of our way because i wanted to try the desserts that were supposed to be so good  went during normal business hours but it was closed with a sign that said will open at  pm  if you say youre going to be opened be opened  this actually happened about a year ago but they removed my original review because they said it was against the user agreement because i didnt actually eat there  well i sure as hell tried  its my fault they arent opened when they say they will be  glad its closedbwow it is amazing to me how much people enjoy to complain this place is actually really good i went here a few months ago with my sister and a few friends we are all huge gordon ramsay fans they must have improved things immensely because we all thoroughly enjoyed our food i ordered the smoke salmon flatbread and for dessert i had a candy bar pie i believe its called it was really good and the presentation of the food was very well put together i didnt meet amy however i met sammy and he was really nice you can tell he means well and cares about his staff and customers he even took a picture with my sister and her friends that she of course posted on facebook i wish i had it to upload to my review my sister stayed later than i did i had to leave to go to a concert the owner was nice enough to offer to put my food in a fridge until my sister was ready to leave so my food didnt spoil  when i left it is a little pricey but the food is worth it my sister also ordered a gin and tonic he made it very strong which she really liked we will definitely be backball our food was either under cooked or way over cooked its a pizza how can you screw it up so horribly waist of moneybhonestly i think many of these reviews are bull some of these people probably havent been there and they are just writing based on the drama they saw in the show nnmy husband and i went for a wedding in phoenix and of course i had to see the amys baking company because i am a big fan of kitchen nightmaresnnthe service nnsammy was really nice asked how our day was going he put us on the table and took our orders actually he took care of our table there were more  or  tables with people not full  i was impressed because i thought he would be rude angry but he wasnt at all he seems to be a simple old man he took a good care of us came back many times asking if the food was good if we needed anything else he was not at all the crazy man i saw on the show reallynnfoodnnyes i have to agree that the sandwich i got was not good i mean it was ok nothing special i can make a better one at home i think she puts too much oil on the bread and makes it too way grassy i ordered a prosciutto panini and a cake which i cant remember the namebut it was really good seriously the cake was divine nnmy husband got a humus  i think its garlic humus and it was really good i should have gone for that one too i regret of getting that sandwich he also got a iece of cake it was a chocolate and some brown filling really good too nnas i said i was impressin a good way nobody gave me a bad atitude i didnt hear anyone yelling and sammy was very nice to usbi rarely if ever write reviews however this is pretty shocking i actually found this review trying to find a number for amys so that i can order dinner and was shocked by what i read  i live within walking distance of amys but only tried it for the first time with a friend a couple of months ago  when walking past it occasionally while walking my pooch it always appeared to be fairly empty which is typically a bad sign for a restaurant  despite the seemingly frightening availability of seats my friend and i decided to give amys a chance and we were pleasantly surprised  the food and service were great in fact the pizza was the some of the best ive had since moving here and that is saying a lot as i am from chicago and relocated to the area from brooklyn where i lived for  years  by no means am i an expert but ive had my fair share of delicious pizza  i thought that the gentleman who served us was very polite and accommodating as he rushed our order knowing that we were attempting to grab dinner before a movie nni came in again for the pizza a month later and he remembered me and apologized in advance for the delay because he was shortstaffed and attending to a fairly large party i was still able to get my pizza to go without any issues and i was even offered a free appetizer due to the wait although i did not wait for that long so my service experience has clearly been different  ive also never tried going there for dinner at  pm as i didnt even know there were restaurants nonchain at least in scottsdale opened that late any night of the week lolnnive had a few items off the menu  the caramelized onion and fig pizza my favorite item the crostinis they are offered with a couple of different toppings the appetizer of french fries the monte cristo and the martini with pomegranate juice i cant think of a single complaint on any of the dishes that ive triednni will say that well its scottsdale and i am fairly shocked when i see people whine about prices you can go across the street to dickies and spend  on the worlds worse bbq so i think  for a reasonably sized pizza really isnt that bad even at pita jungle youll be hardpressed to spend less than  on a pita and side item whereas in most momandpop greek dives in chicago i can get a d good gyros with hand cut fries for about  nnill also acknowledge that the owners response to criticism was unprofessional i can understand that criticism even when constructive can be hard to take but it has become a part of the business  customers no longer just go home unsatisfied they go home and blog about their unsatisfactory experiencennin short i will still head to amys and enjoy my pizza dinner while most likely walking on egg shells to avoid making anyone angry lol id recommend giving the place a shot at the very least try the pizza with caramelized onions prosciutto and figs and forming an opinion of your own despite the reviews you might be pleasantly surprisedbbest salad i have had in a very long time  i had the spicy peanut salad with grilled chicken the dressing is freshly made and is wonderful we also tried the chocolate raspberry mousse cake  to die for  we had amazing personalized service calming lovely atmosphere  i broke my  day diet and it was so worth it  i would love to come backbfood taste like shit as well as their customer service they cant take criticism at all and the owners flip out for the truth i saw them from kitchen nightmares from chef ramsey let me say its far worse then a nightmare i decided to go check it out myself and see if it is actually what the show presented them to be theyre not lying the owner is delusionalbi ate at this place when in town for a baseball game the food was not that great i asked the  man standing at the  register to take it back and he started talking shit then the cook came out and started running her mouth calling me a hater i didnt understand why they were going left field on me and my party after a few words were exchanged payed for the shit food and left what a joke of a place to eat i will be sure to tell everybody i know in that town not to go thereblike most people i went in for the curiosity factor after the whole kitchen nightmares deal  i was pleasantly surprised sammy was very friendly and very accommodating  i had a tomatobasil potato gnocchi which was very good and flavourful  although a little too much sauce   i also tried a glutenfree chocolate truffle which cutely enough said meow on it which was ridiculously gooood  ni would definitely go backbi only write reviews on two occasions  when an experience is so awful i must spare others from a disaster or two when an experience is so unbelievable that i think the establishment deserves the good pressnnafter spending some time with my mom and sisters on a saturday afternoon we were heading toward our regular lunch spot pita jungle next door to abc bistro i being the adventurous one i am convinced the rest of my family to try out this cute little bistro since we always pass by it while running errands in that shopping plazanni am so glad i did this place is legit i am so happy i stopped in there today as my family and all of my friends will now be regulars at this establishmentnnthe prices are incredibly reasonable especially for the quality of food and service that you receive im a huge supporter of the finer foods rather than commercialized venues and this place reminds me of those exceptional and warm cafes on nearly every street in parisnnabc bistro is fine european dining and i am so happy i found this place i can hear my sister raving to my father about as im typing thisnnas for the food if i could give it more than  stars i wouldnnfor appetizers order the italian bread  for a pizzasize amount of bread we also ordered the artichoke dip and the fig crostini the latter of which is phenomenalnnfor lunch we all ordered paninis and pastas  the portions are great size we all finished our plates and were perfectly full for  a panini and salad that is tasty and filling in a sophisticated european restaurant setting is more than reasonablennnow for the best part the desserts my god the desserts we each ordered one  each delicious and generously sized that we had to take the rest home better than commercialized cheesecake factory garbagennthe bistro also has a full bar and a great happy hour menu i ordered the raspberry champagne martini  and it was quite strong delicious and underpricednnthe atmosphere is gorgeous i was admiring the chandeliers furniture decor throughout our entire extended meal  and the owners are kind and friendly peoplennafter reading all of the negative reviews on here i am honestly shocked by anyone who had a less than star experience those of you who didnt have a good experience obviously have no taste when it comes to fine european dining and might have better luck heading over to california pizza kitchen or the macaroni grill you will only find the best ingredients and food quality at this establishmentnnas for a few peoples trouble with no free bread the italian bread appetizer is  if you cant manage to spend that theres an arbys across the street additionally do not go to a classy bistro such as this and share an entree with another individual it wont work in european cafes and it wont work at abc bistro either its also very tasteless and offensive to the restaurant itself in europe this behavior is considered frugal and offensive  so in the same manner do not do this in a proclaimed european dining facilitynnsamy and amy you two are great dont mind any of the negative reviews on this site  those people probably wouldnt have ordered more than one appetizer to split anyway ill certainly be back with all my family and all my friendsnnbon appetitbmy daughter and i moved to scottsdale from chicago recently and stumbled upon amys baking co  i wouldnt call myself a foodie however i know good service and good italian food  years of fine dining ex was italianwhatever  day  here in scottsdale we decided to try a couple different things  on the menu hoping for leftovers empty fridge at home we ordered bbq cx mango pizza margherita pizza pear salad warm spinach salad  and wine  the seating outside is niceeven though its a parking lot view you soon forget  the atmosphere is lovely  food came with precision timing and was delicious  our eyes were bigger than our appetites and wanted to save room for dessert we wrapped most of the pizza for home and had creme brxcxbblxcxae  for dessert  excellent  the pizza fyi isnt the same the next day its just so fresh  we met sami and amy they were warm and friendly welcoming us to az  the dessert is  star food is  star and staff atmosphere is  star  nnpeople next to us had burgers and made comment as to how tasty they werenndays later i found out about some controversy with a reality show and amys baking co  i find it hard to believe  they were very nicebcame here with an open mind with a group of nno appetizers were orderednni personally ordered the fig and proscuitto pizza and omgnit was delicious  really good so good that i can confidently say id like to come back just for the pizza  nni sampled a few other peoples food at the table and i gotta say i was impressednnwe ordered a variety of desserts and i was able to sample the chocolate mousse as well as the key lime pie im allergic to nuts so i wasnt able to try them all and omg againnso goodnnthe server was good though she did seem a bit defensive nnid come back for surebive seen the episode on kitchen nightmares and i just couldnt believe that gorden didnt fix it so i went to see for my self it was  min in to service and my appetizer didnt come so i went to to the conter than they started swaring at mendo not go therebi did enjoy the desserts although my blue ribbon burger was on the raw side i did have it sent back and just to be told it was actually well done i was talk down on and felt really disrespected ni will inform friendsfamily that this isnt worth your time nor money to eat at  nnote to owners if you treat your customers with respect they will be loyal and refer friends and family to your establishmentbabsolutely disgusting and im not talking about the food the owners are foul people with zero sense of customer service very rude and aggressive the older guy who owns it i think his name is sammy was the rudest person i have ever come across cursing at customers over the phone and in the restaurant in front of everyone with no shame whatsoever and i have had better pizzas from papa johns and dominoes if i could give this place negative stars i wouldbi had a great time the food was good the owner was very friendly and nice at one point the chef came out to introduce herself after watching chef ramseys show i had low expectations and i admit i was a little biased   i fully recommend this place and i will definitely eat here againbi did it  i went there  i fully admit i loved the train wreck of an episode that was kitchen nightmares but my  year old little girl loved it more and begged to go to this place on our next visit out  i am working on mom of the year so i took her haha nnmy  year old son was with us  my sis her man and his daughter came as well  three kids and according to yelp this is not a good place for kids gulp  we were there on july  early eve  i will start with the restaurant and i have not a bad thing to say  it was clean and it was gorgeous  the menu was surprising  for a nonkids place the menu listed a kiddie pasta dish for   fabulous  our waitress seemed to be making up for the past crazy by being overly sugary sweet  at first it was nice but honestly it got annoying  nnwe started with hummus and some dipping bread  this was absolutely delicious  we also ordered a pepperoni pizza a ham and cheese panini a caesar salad and the kids pasta  the food was fairly timely  had we no children i dont think there would have been a rush but bored kids really emphasize how long it takes to get food in a restaurant  i am happy to say that all of the food was very good  my son did not like the pasta but my sisters bf loved it  i did send it back to get doctored up with some sauce and there seemed to be no freaking out in the kitchen over this debacle  unfortunately my son still turned his nose up at it  i think the problem is that it is a little fancy for a high percentage of kids that are likely used to prego  dont judge me  that infamous caesar that was featured on tv was very good  i think if you read the menu you wont be surprised  it actually spelled out what was in the salad so i knew what i was going to be getting  the pizza was awesome and the panini was very good  the girls ordered desserts and not only were they gorgeous but they really were wonderful  amy even offers a flourless chocolate cake that is glutenfree  nnthe best part was that amy was very very nice to the little girls  my daughter really wanted to meet amy  not only did she get to meet her but amy actually chatted with the kids and took a photo with them  but she didnt stop there  she gave the kids some plastic hello kitty ringsnni was out in scottsdale for a visit  i dont live there  however if i did i would occasionally frequent this place  if absolutely for nothing else the dessert case is spectacular and i really dont care who is baking  and parents  put your minds at rest  i think amy might like kids almost as much as she likes cats  meowbi wish i could give them  star the food was meh i could whip up a tv dinner and it would taste the same honestly but the worst thing was the service and overall atmosphere the male owner husband was a bully i really didnt enjoy my sandwich much but i swear i was way to afraid to say anything he kept giving me this look i cant describe it really and it just made me feel like i needed to eat fast and leave i would highly recommend that no one goes there to eat i know its mean but its the truth the food and stress isnt worth itbi wish i could complain about the food i really do but i cant  i obviously went because i saw both kitchen nightmares episodes and my hubby wouldnt come with me so i went alone  sammy greeted me at the front no other workers were there when i first came in and he was really pleasant  i was going to just take dinner togo but felt like once i was there i needed to stay there  it was dead  granted it was a tuesday night at around  pm but there was seriously one other party of  and me  so anyway i got a huge kick out of the restaurant obviously getting crank called multiple times when i was there sammy picked up the phone and said who a few times and then said gordon ramsey and walked to the back of the kitchen  i was expecting to hear shouts and curses but alas no such luck  i could see amy in the kitchen but didnt really get a good look  as soon as i thought the show was complete bs sammy did not stop talking about kitchen nightmares gordon ramsey and ramsey apparently sexually assaulting his wife  ummm what he went on for a good  minutes to the party of  in the back of the restaurant and by that time a hostess had come in so i just caught her eye and asked her if this happens a lot  she rolled her eyes and went every day  i mean it was kind of funny because thats why i went there but come on man i was hoping youd just yell at me and not talk badly on gordon ramsey haha  it was a very awkward experience but probably didnt help that i just went on a whim by myself  i definitely needed someone there to experience it about the food though  i got their goat cheese spinach salad and it was delicious  next time  i need to try the pizza theyve gotten so many mixed reviews on  next time amys baking company  next timebordered the blue ribbon burger  over cooked and tasted baked not grilled  maybe it was one of the topping ingredients but it had an off putting flavor  frozen fries  e ambience is nice for being in a strip mall i guess  wont go backbi love abc honestly the first time i went there was because i watched kitchen nightmares and i wanted to see if all the horrors on the show were true they werent the restaurant itself is beautiful and spotless with very classy decor sammy is one of the nicest most courteous waiters i have ever had in my life including at four star restaurants and amy is just as friendly and a kick ass cook my boyfriend and i have been here at least four times and every time we go is phenomenal weve had pasta which was perfectly cooked and presented beautifully and weve had some of their newer dishes like the arugula salad and ham and cheese panini  amys paninis melt in your mouth and have so much flavor the outside has the perfect crunch and the inside is soft and melty  i could eat them any day of the week dont even get me started on her desserts one of the best creme brulee i have ever had in my entire life and amazing chocolate tarts i am a huge coffee snob i wont touch the likes of starbucks and i drink it black their coffee is out of this world best ive ever had in arizona nnbottom line if youre going to write at bad review at least go writing a bad review for a product you have never tried is not only cowardly youre just a sheep a lemming following others off the cliff and missing out on some awesome food i went to abc expecting it to be terrible boy was i wrongbare you lovers or hatersnnthats how amys baking company owner samy bouzaglo greeted my platonic girl friend and i when we walked into the notorious eatery made famous by gordon ramsays kitchen nightmares well we do love each other so we hesitantly answered lovers before taking a seat outside on the patio of the nearlyempty restaurantnnsamy was our server and was extremely cheerful and smiley  how a welcoming host should be he was helpful in talking about the menu explaining the inch garlic mushroom chicken pizza  my friend ordered would be big enough to share  it definitely was  and he brought out our drinks cheerfullynnthe food seemed to take a little long to deliver more than  minutes considering there were only maybe a couple other tables filled inside but hopefully thats because amy whom we met was actually making everything by scratchnnwe both really enjoyed our food i thought my dish the tomato spinach ravioli with a tomato cream sauce and fresh spinach was really tasty  though i have no idea if the pasta was fresh or frozen i really liked the cream sauce and the ravioli filling was scrumptious too i did think at only about four ravioli per dish it was a little overpriced at  thoughnnmost of the menus entrees are around  which makes eating lunch here pretty pricey and though the pizza was massive enough for my friend to take half home itd be cooler if there were smaller less expensive portions to choose from at lunchnni did get a togo dessert a slice of delicious blueberry pie samy did insist amy makes all the desserts so ill give kudos to her since they all looked great but my pie slice was   again pretty priceynni have to admit i was really scared to go to amys baking company since id seen the episode of kitchen nightmares they were featured in and theyre back on again on friday february  on fox as we were leaving samy and amy said theres about to be a war  possibly alluding to what happened during the filming of the new episode im supercurious what went down and will not go back until the next airing  but for now im glad i at least made it out alive with a happily full stomachbwe came in strictly to see what all the hype was aboutnnwe had sammy as our server food was pretty good  i really enjoyed the fig pear and prosciutto pizzannsammy did forget a salad that our friend ordered but they ended up bringing it out and not charging us for itnnwe were in and out in a little over an hour and went to our movie next doornnthe great thingsammy offered to hold my left over pizza for me at the restaurant until after our movie was done  that way it didnt go bad in the car in the arizona heat  nnnext time we are down there way again we will definitely go backbi ate here for dinner with my husband  we are visiting scottsdale from chicago and we had a fantastic experiencennboth sammy and amy were very sweet and accommodating  our food came out in a timely fashion   sammy asked us how our food was tasting every time we got a new dish we got drinks an appetizer entree and dessert  really great service and they obviously really care about their customers and their experiencennall of the food was so good  i absolutely love italian food and this is the best italian ive had since i got to az nnwe got the flat bread for our appetizer and it was nicely seasoned and garlickynnmy husband ordered the sweet and spicy pasta rustica  my husband loved his dish  i got  the tomato basil gnocci and it was delicious  the home made sauce was so goodnnwe both got dessert and it was very rich in flavor and taste  it was a very sweet ending to a great experience nnoverall the ambiance was nice and the prices were reasonable  nnwe will definitely be coming backbmy fiancee and i brought my daughter to amys for her th birthday upon her request  we ordered the artichoke and jalapexcxbo dip with the flat bread and it was absolutely amazing we also had pizza and dessert and everything was great  amy even came out to wish my daughter a happy birthday  dont believe the negative hype  the food is good  i think it is really unfortunate that people are bashing them just because of the show this is their livelihood  i thought sammy and amy were very nice people and the food was very goodbsamy was extremely polite and attentive as our host and waiter might come back for a coffee and dessert nice atmosphere beautiful restaurant decor we had seen kitchen nightmares and was curious about the hype so we decided to try it food was average and a little unusual i never ate pear in a sandwich and never have since overall we were expecting a spectacle but it seemed business as usual and uneventfulbunderwhelming experience to say the least  slow service and the food wasnt all that great for the price  the one saving grace was the desertamazing  wait staff was okseemed a bit overwhelmed thoughbthe food is frozen the owners are  two  people in denial they are rude no class fools that do not belong in the food or any type of  contact with the public she out there in left field and hes cluelessbbest hummus flat bread combo in town  its simply perfect just like the french press coffee  such well done classics are accented with imaginative pastries and pizza toppings  weve learned from talking up one half of the abc team sammy while his wife amy is hard at work in the kitchen that most everything is made in house  including the fig jam and red pepper marmalade that have become an unexpected pizza topping obsession for my girlfriend and i  even though i was scared of the mango bbq chicken pizza she talked me into it and i didnt regret it passionate imaginative flavors and service we want to go back every weekboksoim usually very quick to give bad reviews to places ive eaten at noone cares about good service and food anymore but i just cant be negative today i knowit hurts me too we stopped by here on our way through scottsdale on a friday morning at around noon the place has a lot of seating but was completely empty we didnt have time to stop and eat but were more interested in the bakery items up front the case wasnt too large but held a good amount of delicious looking desserts samy was very nice in explaining the dessertsflavors to us we ended up with the bread pudding and a slice of cream filled layered chocolate cake  a dessert somewhat pricey but they appeared to be well made so its worth a try rightnthe chocolate cream filled layered cake was delicious my husband and i agreed that it was the best cake weve ever had super flavorful and thick without being too rich i wish i wouldve gotten morenthe bread pudding was good but the cake was better  i think the walnuts in the bread pudding threw it off for me but others might prefer it either way both desserts were very quality  and definitely worth the stop if their dessert is that good i wonder how their food is next time im in the area ill definitely be giving it a tryni guess my only suggestion would be to change the red sign on the outside of the place its so tacky and generic and doesnt really fit the feel of what theyre trying to go for on the inside a black sign with white font might be more attractiveneither way great job on the desserts deliciousnedit i really hope samy and amy open up another location it makes me super sad to see theyre closed im moving to the phoenix area within the next couple months and was really hoping to make this one of my regular stops  boobi never knew about this place till i saw the kitchen nightmares show we drove down from anthem just to check out the drama unfortunately there was none just good dare i say great service and good foodnnthe price seemed crazy high for a chocolate mousse pie i think it was around  for the piece but it was perhaps the best i ever have had the only problem is i finished it in just a couple bites probably  calories per bite but what do you expectnnwe had the mediterranean pizza it was good not great but plenty good to not complain about it yes it was cooked just fineno raw dough not nearly as good as some of the other pizza joints in the valley like spinatos httpwwwyelpcomsearchfinddescspinatospizzafindlocphoenixcazns but very good nonethelessnnsammy the owner was watching everything like a hawk he had the waiters and bus boys moving around like a drill sergeant would they seemed slightly scared and insecure i probably would not have noticed it had i not seen the show but because of the show i was on heightened alert i wouldnt want to be one of their employees but as a customer i liked the attention i received i probably had my water glass filled  timesnnthe big question is would i go back hmm it seemed overpriced to me being outside of old town but the food was good i dont think i would make a special trip but if i was ever in old town and in the mood for an excellent chocolate mousse i probably wouldnnif the prices came down  i think id go more often but now maybe just once a yearbthis place is worse than they showed on tv  the cook doesnt know how to cook and the husband runs around like an idiot with his head cut off the pizza is horrid the baked items taste like cardboard i wish i could give  stars because this has to be the worst run restaurant in the world the owners are truly too stupid to live run away from this quagmire of a restaurantbamy and sammy were about as good as it gets amy was a magician in the kitchen her food was the equal of sex sorry to see them go i wish the best for them i know they wished the best for there customers good luck on your next endeavors we hope to meet you and savor your great food once againbi had the hummus and pizza  all i can say is season stuff and start to cook the pizzas  very pricey and not worth a repeat visitbpizza was horrible creme brulee saved the day though they really should focus on a deserts onlybits so obvious that the people who write lousy reviews for this place have never been here and are just jumping on the bandwagon  my wife and i and some friends went tonight expecting to see craziness and chaos and ended up eating some incredible food they have a white pizza that was no joke the best pizza ive ever had im a fatty dont take that compliment lightly i love pizza this had this savory almost custardlike sauce that blew my mind  the desserts are so amazing and rich theyre obviously made with love and lastly the owners were very gracious and so sweet we visited with them at length leave these poor people alone already and actually try the food you wont be let downbdelicious and entertaining nni flew in scottsdale and this was my first stop  had to visit these awesome personalities  nni was seated by a waitress sammy came right away and directed the waitress to seat me in a more spacious location  i decline and told him this was my choosing  he looked stymied   it was epic nnthen we chatted about a good five minutes  i love his passion and its well deserved as their restaurant shows a lot of pride of ownership  i ordered the hummus as it doesnt come with bread he recommended that i order bread with it but i declined   i said i will use the pizza for that  he was puzzled by his logic the hummus was one of the best i tasted and i know hummus  ask for less olive oil on top if are not used to it nni ordered the fig prosciutto pizza and has a a slice from another guest of bbq mango chicken  both were incredible nnother mentions  he said he was scammed by kitchen nightmares with paid actors and editing  also sammy is originally from israel  i was guessing italian or lebanese nnalso great job amy you are truly a artist im already craving the hummus  nnnall in all great food  fun people gobwe have revisited three times impressed and enjoyed every time their chocolate cake is out of this worldbthe worse place ive ever  been  food is undercooked soggy and the owners are incompetent with service  all i heard is them talking and bashing gordon ramseynseriously look in the mirror  this place should be closedbi tried the pizza and it was completely undercooked my wife ordered the burger and it was a soggy messnnni also think the desserts are being bought from somewhere else and brought innni wont be returning any time soonbi ate here while visiting family during vacation i had no idea this was on tv until i came to write this review these people are rude and crazy the restaurant is super slow and the food is horrible i wish that i would have seen kitchen nightmares ahead of time these people are terrible and i hope they closebtwo friends and i went by to see what all the fuss was about  none of us have any opinion on the food due to waiting over  minutes for our appetizers  we simply left  the water was good i guessbok to be honest we decided to check this place out because of the media and show kitchen nightmares  i did see the show and i couldnt believe the behavior of the owners  we both agreed not to buy food off the menu but we both agreed to try the pastries in the glass case i just have to say that her cakes are delicious they are very pretty too   i did not get to see the craziness that worked in the kitchen i did have a little conversation with the husband husband about the sweets behind the glass he was kind to us and friendly my friend actually felt i bit sorry for him  i did see the show and kept my guard up i can tell he was keeping a close eye on every single person that walked in that door so i didnt take pictures on the down low just because i was afraid he would break my phone  we had a really helpful server i felt sorry for just cause i am sure she never gets her tips ok now to my pie  i got the white chocolate coconut pie it was not overly sweet it was just right for me it was actually perfect i will say good things about good things that i experience  and that pie was good if i am ever in area to satisfy my craving for good desserts i will stop here  i am hesitant on the meals there just because of some reviews and what i have seen on tv oh well who knows i might if i get talked into it oh parking sucks just thought i would throw that in toobyikes i must be honest i went in thinking the tv show embellished the crazy thats in this place i was wrong had a pizza it was undercooked just asked if it could be cooked a little longer and got yelled at was told to leave but not before i paid for food i didnt even take a bite of do not go here do not feed these people egos i cant believe they are still open hoping karma will work quickly for amys bakerybi wish i could give no stars amy youre a crazy freak and when the doors close everyone will be laughing at you i stopped by to check this place out while out of town just because of the show these two are idiots i tried the fig pizza soggy disgusting and just unpleasant to the eye the burgers taste like walmart patties by the way if you call that hummus youre an idiot amy couldnt cook if her life depended on it please everyone stop going to see if its actually like the show showed us they are thieves with no taste buds as soon as we stop supporting them theyll go away and then maybe amy can take a cooking classbtotal kitchen nightmare fan here my fiancxcxa and i were on a roadtrip and scottsdale just happened to be on the way we were an hour away from the restaurant at that time their hours werent posted on yelp i called in to ask what time they closed samy answered we will keep the kitchen open for you we arrived right when they were closing and we were extremely exhausted and hungry but samys warm greeting was so uplifting it just made the whole dining experience soooo much more pleasant nnoh my goodness the food is amazing i had the spicy pasta rustica i loved this dish my fiance had the cold chicken penne pasta salad which hes been trying to recreate ever since we came here but hasnt been able to hahahabthis place is awesome has incredible authentic food we come here every time we are in scottsdalenwe went tonight not having been back in

many times and love their  pizza one of the best in town sammy the owner treats his customers with a friendly nature which i enjoy  the food shines and brings us back often as they make great salads and pasta also it deserves  stars in our book we have introduced our  friends and now they make it a weekly destination also alicebvisiting town this was horrible i asked for a remake on my burger got yelled at and treated like a  year old i walked out and they followed me out demanding paymentbi had dinner last night samy was the only one waiting tables the place was busy and he did a great job supper nice man i said a quick hello to amy after having dinner and she was very sweet my meal was wonderful the hummus was out of this world the pasta rustica was really good portions are huge  please give them a try and forget about kn  these folks really work hard to provide a nice meal ill be back againnnbob the pilotbwas back in scottsdale last night and had to return to amys nnfood was absolutely amazing i had the humus again which is out if this world and also enjoyed the fig and prosciutto pizza nhad to have desert so i tried the cheesecake im from ny originally so i know cheesecake amys was one of the best i ever hadnnsamy and amy thank you for an enjoyable evening i hope to return soon all the bestnnbobnthe pilotbcalled the place and told him that i had a group of  ladies what were going to come in asked what time they were open till and he said  but they close the kitchen at  when i told him we were going to be in around  and he told me that there was nothing he could do and wouldnt accept my business welp fuck you too dudebfirst off the food was not that great i had the pizza which tasted very dull and greasy i did not have the chance to meet sammy or amy kinda disappointed i dont recommend coming here because they want tourists to come in and see how bad the place really is they treat their customers and employes like trashbdo not waste your time  the service as well as overall attitude from the owners is irreparable i would not have wasted my time if i would have known how the owners did not care about their customers and more about their ego  food is overpriced and not worth itbate here this fall when i was visiting the area of course i came because of the show but i wanted to try things for myself smaller menu than what was in the show and only amy working the kitchen this change must have been the right move for them because everything i ate including the desert was phenomenal i went back multiple times in the week and a half i was in scottsdale also amy and samy are two of the nicest people i have ever met what most people do not understand is that they were approached by the kitchen nightmare casting group multiple times they did not call the show for help i can understand why amy was defensive in the tv show yes her and her husband are eccentric but they are passionate and amy has a true talent i encourage everybody to try the place for themselves before passing judgmentbbarf food was nasty i would not recommend the dessert tasted old like when did you make this last year i made a special trip to visit this and blehhhh dont do it do not eat the cat food they are servingbwe hadnt seen the show but while dining the owner sammy mentioned it so we went there unprejudiced  first of all we met both owners and they were super nice  we got our food in a timely manner and it was delicious  we got a cheese panini and a turkey sandwich  yummmm  then a chocolate cake which was heavenly  we will have to check out the show but as an unbiased reviewer we loved itbme and a couple friends decided we wanted to try out amys baking company were from out of state and ate out nearly every meal and amys was by far the greatest meal we had the customer service the food the atmosphere was outstanding even better than the entree was the dessert i had the best creme brxcxbblxcxae i have ever had in my life i cant wait to return here next time im in scottsdalebi travel down to phxscottsdale a couple of times a year to visit my friends and this last time i begged my friend to stop at abc because i had seen gordon ramseys show and wanted to see what all the fuss was about nnonce inside the restaurant was empty which surprised me since it was a busy saturday afternoon the reason i surmise is because of the very busy movie cineplex sharing the same parking lot  parking was an issue but i blame that on the theatrennsamy greeted both my friend and i very cordially and since we were on a time crunch we went straight to dessert the dessert case was super impressive and the selection was amazing  we chose a creme brxcxbblxcxae and a slice of key lime pie  complete with two glasses of bubblynnthe desserts were amazing we both walking out very full and very satisfied  next time we will try the food  but both amy and samy took the time to come out and speak  with us and were very gracious  if you are having problems in az move your bakery to seattle  it would be awesomebi tried this restaurant during a recent vacation and this is the absolute worst food and restaurant i have ever seen in my entire life no wonder gordon ramsay gave up on these two all i know is i have eaten a multiple gordon ramsay restaurantsand i have eaten at amys baking companyno comparison do not eat here you will save yourself the torture of having to endure a crappy meal with crappy servicebi only swung by here after i got some recommendations from the locals after my trip to the sonoran preserve really nice hiking area i only came here for a light meal but it ended to be not the best experience first im surprise with the mix of strong and negative reviews maybe the restaurant just had a reregrand opening but im not the judge so here are my thoughtsnni had a light drink with their glazed seared salmon salad and some garlicy flatbread appetizers i like the fact that they were trying to go organic and include fresh options however i wish the salmon was not overcooked and the honey citrus glaze had a funky aftertaste im not sure what is up with thatnntheir desserts did look appetizing but i did not have room for that nnconclusions im not a big fan of their food there was an uncomfortable confrontation at the front house very odd and unsettling environment yet i do like the dxcxacor and a try for fresh ingredients towards their italianstyle dishes but i was expecting more of a baking restaurant than anything its an alright place i thinkbterrible people will never return would rather eat at a gas station frozen food section  greasy n raw sum it upbgross gross gross omg mold on the cheesecake and try to argue with me that its the leaf of the raspberry ummmmm no there was mold all over the raspberries and still charged us rude and horrible no gobwent in for lunch today and was a pleasant experience  atmosphere is really nice and the owner was a gracious host  ordered the sausage and pepperoni pizza  and the crust was one of the best ive ever tasted  pricing is a little high  but its scottsdalebi flew in scottsdale for a job interview and yes had to try it out i love gordon ramsey and these people should have listened i really just blame amy i ordered a very simple sausage and pepperoni pizza and  inches around from the center of the pizza was soggy it was weird i didnt eat much nnand i was hoping one of the owners would yell at a patron thats probably the main reason why i went sure enough there was some arguing i didnt hear exactly what they said but the customer was showed the door it was good entertainment  star for thatnncuriosity killed the cat never againbi went here as a tourist expecting to get the whole kitchen nightmare experience and i cant say one bad thing about the place  the food was a little overpriced but everything we had was good  veggie pizza  spinach pesto gnocchi and oir daughter had a simple penne with tomato sauce we took two desserts to go everyone was incredibly friendly i did advise my husband not to leave a tip knowing that the servers dont see a penny of it but  he left a tip anyway becase the husband was in front serving us as well  i wouldnt come out of my way to eat here again bit it was definitely not the nightmare i was anticipatingbjust because i was in the area and i saw the show worst experience and crap foodbamy with your attitude you will never never grow no matter how good your food is your attitude will kill you after what i saw on chef ramseybmost awful place in the world the food was disgusting and the owners got mad at a customer for wanting his salmon cooked more this place was on kitchen nightmares and i agree with ramsey however the lemon cake wasnt too bad still i would never come back to those food nazisbi had to give it a star  i want to give it a minus but they dont have a minus ratingni had the pizza and it was pretty bad sammy did ask me how the food was but if he looked at my plate i think that was easy to see as i only ate a portion of itbi went to amys with an open but curious mind as usual an empty stomach and a taste for adventure we went to say goodbye to our friend who is moving to dc  to do what us yelpers do best try something new eat drink  write a reviewnwe were greeted by the infamous sammy who in minutes accomodated our request for numerous tables to seat our group of which most had yet to arrive i told him of my admiration of the pretty chandeliers decor of the restaurant he responded in kind about their food complimented his wife and gave me a hug yes surprised me too nin a daze i moved on distracted by the display of several desserts i was greeted by amy who when i told her i loved the desserts sprinkled in edible glitter  she cracked a joke then complimented my friends shirt nwe were seated  greeted by our friendly server debbie with water  drinks quickly filled  refilled faster than we could drink by more friendly servers after finally deciding i attempted to order the salmon burger but was informed it wasnt available disappointed i quickly selected  the portabella mushroom burger debbie was quicker to inform me that it was a mushroom not really a burger in case i wasnt aware a misconception she said had frequently been made by otherssecrets out i thought the same thing lol pays to read but i went with it anyway my friend and i agreed to do a split  share to try each others selection she ordered a lemon chicken panini crispy on the outside tender and soft on the inside both were tasty although after tasting mine i regretted not keeping it all for myself who knew a mushroom posing as a burger could taste so good  after gazing at the display case we agreed to share a dessert the candybar topped layered in cream filled with mousse sitting on a pie shaped brownie and yes to my delight sprinkled in edible glitter we were quick to make it a disappear glitter and allnwe enjoyed an evening of good food and great servicendespite what you may have heard or read about amys may i suggest trying it for yourselves you might be as i was pleasantly surprisednthank you amys baking company for a memorable  delightful eveningbas soon as i saw the kitchen nightmares episode i wanted to visit abc asap all in all this place was fine not the best food but it wasnt as bad as the show portrayed it i met samy and said hello to him and asked him if i could buy one of his gangster shirts and sadly he said no there food was fine and pastries were good i just wish things could have been a bit crazier maybe a yelling match between samy and a customer but sadly notbhow is this place still open i came just to see if what ive heard was true and the owners are just as bat sht crazy as ive heard stay away nfoodwould be acceptable for far less money but for what they are trying to pull off its just well below the markbill start off by saying that i came to amys baking company with a bit of trepidation i felt like as a tourist the couple wouldnt appreciate an outsider showing up just to see that restaurant that was on kitchen nightmaresni was honestly scared to go into the place fearing that amy and sammy would hate people like me man was i ever wrongnnas i entered the restaurant sammy kindly greeted my friend and i and told us to pick any table to sit at he promptly brought us water and was super friendly to us in every way he gave us two menus and invited us to check out the desert displaynas we looked at the desert display sammy walked us through what each plate was he was calm and articulate and very knowledgeable and proud of what his wife could bakennwe ordered a peanut thai salad with chicken not exact name sorry and a panini again sorry dont know the exact typenthe plates arrived promptly and both were beautifully plated sammy ran us through what was in each dish again as he presented it sammy also bragged about the quality of the food which was great talk up your food if you are proud of itnnthe peanut thai salad was    pretty damn incredible im a big ol fat guy and the salad filled me right up the sauce had a bit of a bite to it which i loved and was tossed with just enough sauce to make me happy but not wanting more the flavor was spot on and the entire plate felt fresh and easy to eatnnthe panini which i snuck a bite of was also fantastic crispy on the outside as it is grill pressed and gooey and warm on the inside the cheese was beautiful i wish i knew what type it was and the side salad of arugula was coated in a very light dressing which was super tasty and did well to hide the bitterness of the arugula nnboth dishes were ten dollars each which in my opinion is a stealnnthen came the deserts a peanut butter chocolate cake and a coconut chocolate cake holy shit you guys i was really stupid to try to finish my entire large salad because i was almost too full to enjoy the amazing deserts nit is pointless to try to explain how great they were just know that im a big fan of sweets and my bar has been now set dangerously high on chocolate based cakes thanks for ruining me for life amy ill have to visit phoenix whenever i want to feel happiness againnnsammy at one point caught me taking pictures of my food and came over to encourage me to post about the food online he again was nothing but kind to me and my friendnnit was weird i felt a bit bad that i had come to the restaurant expecting to see caricatures and instead was met by two very kind and polite restaurant owners im sure that others have had other experiences with the couple but i cannot speak to those experiences both sammy and amy were proud of what they could do and they should be their food was incrediblennboth took the time to take pictures with my friend and i and talked to us for a few minutes about the drama behind the ramsey episodenni would love to visit abc next time i am in phoenix nncome for the possible drama stay for the incredibly priced tasty food if you do not pick up a desert youre an idiotnnalso if you are going to go to abc dont be a prick and harass them just because we have turned their lives into a circus the horror stories that those two told us were pretty grim at the end of the day they are still human beings give them a chance to surprise youbabsolute trash food and mean people on the staff do not come here if you ever come around this area do not come here because all you will receive is abuse the owners are terrible people not to mention they are just arrogant and think their terrible food is the best around i think not stop by taco bell for better food and servicebi visited amys for the first time last friday night before a movie and was very pleased with both the food and service   we shared the spinach salad and the pulled pork pizza  both were excellent and we especially enjoyed the pizza   the young man that waited on us was really helpful and pleasant  i will definitely go backbwas in phoenix for business and tried this place on a whim terrible terrible terrible food undercooked service flimsy at best and owner made you feel like you were eating in a jail house go elsewherebour family of  went here for desserts on mothers day  the staff was amazingly nice i think amy is a pastry chef as all the dessert were excellent and not to sweet just right  our table of six had the brownie apple turnover banana coconut tart key lime pie and creme brulee  the pastry on the apple turnovers were flaky and just right we even took some home  the banana coconut tart looked real sweet but we were pleasantly surprised when there was no sugar overload  the espresso  coffee with the lemon rind was exceptional per my dad  i am a key lime fan  while the filling on the key lime was really good there was too much crust  the crust on key lime pie should not be more than  inch as it is all about the filling not about the crust the staff was super nice  as they were closing a family of  walked in and they stayed opened just for them and never even asked us to leave but they keep giving up free refills  it felt like home a great place for desserts  we will try it for dinner next timebhad dinner there again yesterday and it was as wonderful as our previous times the fig prosciutto pear pizza was amazing they have a special salad with a citrus honey dressing that i love as it isnt too oily added to the mix we had champagne and came away raving check it out and youll be telling your friends about this gem there arent enough restaurants that have this quality at such a reasonable pricebthe owners are just as obnoxious in person as they are on tv a classic fail in just about every aspect while the place was adequately clean samy has quite a chip on his shoulder which is oh so apparent as soon as you walk in gordon ramsey nailed these guys spot on the pizza was undercooked and fairly bland the salad my wife had was not washed properly and had a grit that made it unpleasant and ultimately had to be sent back you would think that after all the attention this place has had in the not too distant past they would be bending over backward to start earning new customers i found that not to be the case it is just a matter of time before they run out of  to keep this sinking ship afloatbhorrible food for the price point the owners are clueless when it comes to hospitality and theyre service is subpar at best also there is serious health code violations at this company the rude management if you can even call it that has no respect  starsbi came in here after all the buzz and find out for myself and it is grooooooooss it tasted microwaved if i wanted frozen food i wouldve gone to walmart and microwaved a stouffers frozen lasagna myself they are so rude and the employees look like hostages i feel so bad for them these are terrible people and they dont deserve to have a business will never come here again even if it was freebi really liked it i thought the key lime pie was divine and i loved the crust we had pizza and a few drinks and we will go back when we see a movie at shea \n"
